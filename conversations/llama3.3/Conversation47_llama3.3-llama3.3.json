Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

It's like you're trying to find your way through a fog without a clear direction. *offers a gentle nod*\n\nYou mentioned wondering what your mom would say or think if she were here.

Grief is a process, and it's normal for it to feel overwhelming and confusing at times. *offers a reassuring smile*\n\nYou mentioned feeling like you're supposed to be doing something, but you don't know what it is.

It's like you're searching for a sense of purpose, but everything feels empty and pointless without your mom by your side.\n\n*Softly speaks* You mentioned wanting to find something that makes you feel connected to your mom again or helps you remember the good times you had together. That's a beautiful desire. Can you think of any specific activities, places, or objects that might help you feel more connected to her? Perhaps something she loved, something you did together, or something that reminds you of her?\n\n*Gently encourages exploration* For example, was there a particular hobby, recipe, or tradition that you shared with your mom that could be a way for you to honor her memory and feel more connected to her? *speaks softly, inviting reflection*\n\nAlso, I want to explore how this emotional pain might be affecting other areas of your life.

Everything feels... off. *pauses, struggling to find the right words* \n\n*Looks up again, searching for understanding* Does that make sense?

  },
  {
    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "*Nods understandingly* It makes perfect sense. Using food as a coping mechanism for emotional pain is a common phenomenon, especially when it comes to comfort foods that evoke feelings of nostalgia and warmth. It's like your body is trying to find solace in the physical sensation of eating, even if it's not addressing the underlying emotional emptiness.\n\n*Gently offers reassurance* Please know that this behavior is not uncommon, and it doesn't mean you're weak or flawed. It's simply a way your mind and body are trying to cope with the overwhelming emotions you're experiencing.\n\n*I lean forward slightly, showing interest* It's interesting that you mention cooking and socializing feeling different without your mom. It sounds like these activities were closely tied to your relationship with her, and now they've become bittersweet reminders of what's missing. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels \"off\" about these activities? Is it the lack of her presence, the memories that come flooding back, or something else entirely?\n\n*Softly explores further* And when you say you're trying to fill the emptiness inside with food, but it never seems to work... what do you think would need to happen for you to feel truly comforted and fulfilled? Is there a specific emotional need that's not being met, or a sense of connection you're longing for? *asks with empathy and curiosity*\n\nAlso, I want to check in with you about your social functioning. Have you been avoiding social interactions or feeling disconnected from friends and family since your mom passed away? How have you been taking care of your energy levels, considering you mentioned earlier that you've been feeling tired all the time? *asks with concern and care*"

    "content": "*I take a deep breath, collecting my thoughts* To be honest, everything feels off because it's just not the same without my mom. Cooking was something we always did together, and now the kitchen feels empty and quiet. Socializing is hard because I feel like I'm just going through the motions, pretending to be okay when really I'm not. And food... food is just a temporary distraction from the pain.\n\n*I pause, looking down* I think what would need to happen for me to feel truly comforted and fulfilled is to find a way to connect with my mom's memory in a positive way. Maybe that means finding a new hobby or activity that reminds me of her, or maybe it means just taking time to reflect on the good times we had together.\n\n*I look up, searching for understanding* As for social interactions, I have been avoiding them a bit. It's hard to be around people who don't understand what I'm going through. And my energy levels... *sighs* I've been trying to take care of myself, but it's hard when everything feels so overwhelming. I just feel tired all the time, like I'm carrying this heavy weight around with me.\n\n*I hesitate, then add* Sometimes I feel like I'm losing myself in all of this. Like, I don't know who I am without my mom anymore. Does that make sense? *asks uncertainly*"

It's a process, and it's not something you need to rush through.\n\n*I lean forward slightly, showing interest* I love that you mentioned finding a way to connect with your mom's memory in a positive way. That's a beautiful goal, and it might be a powerful step towards healing. Can you think of any specific activities or rituals that might help you feel more connected to her? For example, maybe there's a certain recipe she used to make, or a place she loved to visit?\n\n*I gently explore further* And when you say you're losing yourself in all of this... what do you think is the most important part of yourself that you're struggling to hold onto? Is it your sense of purpose, your values, or something else entirely? *asks with empathy and curiosity*\n\nAlso, I want to check in with you about your loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You mentioned earlier that everything feels empty and pointless without your mom. Are there any activities or hobbies that you've stopped doing since she passed away? Are there any things that you used to look forward to, but now feel like a chore? *asks with concern and care*\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's been a few weeks since your mom passed away, and the grief process can be unpredictable. How are you taking care of your physical health during this time? Are you getting enough rest, eating nutritious food, and engaging in some form of exercise or self-care? *asks with genuine concern*"

For so long, my focus was on making sure she was okay, and now that she's gone, I feel a bit lost. I'm struggling to find new things that give me a sense of direction and meaning.\n\n*I pause, thinking about activities and rituals that might help me connect with my mom's memory* You know, my mom loved gardening, and we used to spend hours together in the garden, planting flowers and vegetables. Maybe I could start doing that again, or even just tend to the plants she left behind. That might be a way for me to feel closer to her.\n\n*I look down, considering my values and sense of self* I think what's most important to me is holding onto the values and lessons my mom taught me. She was always so kind and compassionate, and I want to continue living my life in a way that honors those qualities. But it's hard when everything feels so different without her here.\n\n*I sigh, thinking about activities I've stopped doing* Yeah, there are definitely things I've stopped doing since my mom passed away. I used to love reading, but now it just doesn't feel the same. And cooking... well, like I said, that's been tough too. But maybe if I can find a way to connect with my mom's memory through those activities, it might help me start enjoying them again.\n\n*I nod, considering my physical health* You're right, taking care of my physical health is important. To be honest, I haven't been doing great in that department. I've been eating a lot of comfort foods, and I haven't been getting as much exercise as I should. But I know that's not sustainable, and it's not what my mom would want for me. Maybe we can work on finding some healthy coping mechanisms and self-care strategies that will help me take care of myself during this difficult time."

It's not about being perfect; it's about taking small steps towards taking care of yourself during this difficult time.\n\n*I pause, reflecting on our conversation* You know, I think one thing that might be helpful for you is to create a memory book or scrapbook about your mom. This could be a way for you to honor her memory and celebrate your relationship with her.

Whatever it is, I want you to take some time to reflect on how it makes you feel and what you learn from the experience.\n\n*I nod* And remember, you're not alone in this journey.
