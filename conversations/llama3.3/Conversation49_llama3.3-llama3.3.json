Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

When you say \"it all just feels like too much effort,\" what does that mean to you?

What do you think would need to happen for you to start feeling motivated again? Is there something specific that you feel is missing, or something that's holding you back?

Are there any specific thoughts or emotions that you find yourself getting caught up in when you're trying to focus?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that even simple tasks like reading a book or watching a movie feel like a struggle. Has this affected your social life as well?

I've been canceling plans with friends and family because it feels too much to deal with. I don't want to be around people when I'm feeling like this, because I don't want to bring them down or have to pretend to be okay when I'm not. *sighs softly* It's just easier to be alone right now, even though it's not really helping me feel any better."

Maybe there's someone who could offer support or a fresh perspective that might help you feel more connected and less alone.\n\nAnd just to check in, how are you taking care of yourself physically during this time?

Plus, they always try to offer advice or solutions, which can be frustrating when I just need someone to listen.\n\nAs for taking care of myself physically... *sighs* To be honest, it's been a struggle. I've been having trouble sleeping, and when I do sleep, I wake up feeling exhausted. I've also noticed that my appetite has decreased significantly, and I've lost some weight recently.

That can be really tough. But I want you to know that I'm here to listen, and I'll do my best to understand what you're going through without trying to fix everything right away.\n\nRegarding your physical health, it's concerning to hear that you're struggling with sleep, appetite, and weight loss. These can be symptoms of depression, and it's essential to address them. Have you considered seeking medical attention or talking to a doctor about how you're feeling physically? Sometimes, taking care of our physical health can help improve our mental well-being as well.\n\nLet's take a step back and focus on small, manageable things that might help you feel more grounded and motivated. What are some things that you used to enjoy doing, even if it was just for a few minutes a day? Could be something as simple as taking a short walk, reading a chapter in a book, or practicing some gentle stretches. Sometimes, getting back to basics and engaging in activities that bring us comfort can help us build momentum and find our way again.\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of \"burdening\" your friends with your problems.

Do you think they would be understanding and supportive, or do you worry that they would judge you or try to fix everything?"

It might be worth considering talking to a trusted friend or family member about how you're feeling, and letting them know that you just need someone to listen.\n\nI'm so glad you mentioned drawing and painting as things that bring you comfort! Getting back into creative activities can be a great way to express yourself and tap into your emotions. It might also help you feel more connected to yourself and your sense of identity. Would you be willing to try setting aside some time each day or week to engage in these activities, even if it's just for a few minutes?\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. You don't have to have all the answers, and it's normal to feel uncertain about your path forward.

It's okay to take your time, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.\n\nBefore we move forward, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling physically. You mentioned earlier that you've been struggling with sleep, appetite, and weight loss. Have you noticed any changes in these areas recently, or are there any other physical symptoms that you're experiencing? It's essential to address these concerns and make sure you're taking care of your overall well-being.\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of \"losing your sense of identity and purpose\" further. What do you think has contributed to this feeling, and what do you hope to achieve or experience in the future that would help you regain a sense of direction and fulfillment? Is there something specific that you're looking forward to, or something that you're hoping to accomplish in the next few weeks or months?\n\nLet's work together to break down some of these feelings and concerns, and see if we can't find ways to help you feel more grounded and connected to yourself. Would you be willing to try some small experiments or activities that might help you tap into your creativity and sense of purpose? Perhaps we could start with something as simple as setting aside 10-15 minutes each day to engage in a creative activity, or taking a short walk outside to clear your head. What do you think?"

But I haven't really talked to anyone about it or sought out medical attention, so maybe that's something we could explore further?\n\n*looks up, slightly hopeful* Do you think...do you think it's possible for me to find my way again?

It just means that you're human, and you're going through a tough time.\n\nRegarding your physical symptoms, I think it's really important that we prioritize your health and well-being. I would strongly encourage you to speak with a medical professional about your sleep, appetite, and weight loss. They can help you rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to these symptoms, and provide guidance on how to get back on track.\n\nIn terms of finding your sense of direction and purpose, I think it's great that you're open to exploring new things and trying different activities. Sometimes, all it takes is a small spark or catalyst to help us find our way again.

We can start with tiny steps, like setting aside time for creative activities or taking short walks, and gradually build up to bigger challenges as you become more comfortable.\n\nRemember, finding your way again is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take your time, and it's okay to make mistakes along the way. The most important thing is that you're taking small steps towards self-care, self-compassion, and exploration.\n\nHow does that sound? Is there anything specific that you'd like to focus on or work towards in our next session?
