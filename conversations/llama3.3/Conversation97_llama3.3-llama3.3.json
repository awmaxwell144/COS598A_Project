    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

And even when I failed or made mistakes, she'd be there to help me pick up the pieces and learn from them.\n\nI think what I'm missing the most is her validation.

For example, if you were to remind yourself that you are capable and competent, just as your mom would have reminded you - how do you think that would feel?

I might feel like I can finally breathe a sigh of relief, you know? Like, I don't have to be perfect all the time.\n\nAnd yeah, speaking to myself in the same way my mom used to speak to me... that's a nice idea. I think it would feel comforting, like having a warm hug from the inside out. It's funny, I never realized how much her words of encouragement meant to me until she was gone. Now, I'm trying to fill that gap with my own self-compassion.\n\nAs for what \"good enough\" means to me... *hesitates* I think it's a mix of both my own expectations and external pressures. Growing up, my mom always encouraged me to strive for excellence, but she also reminded me that it's okay to make mistakes. But then, there are all these societal messages telling us we need to be perfect, successful, and accomplished. It's hard not to internalize those messages and feel like I'm not measuring up.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that my idea of \"good enough\" is still evolving. I'm trying to figure out what it means to me, beyond just external validation or expectations. It's like, I want to be able to look in the mirror and say, \"You know what? You're doing your best, and that's good enough.\" *smiles slightly* Does that make sense?"
