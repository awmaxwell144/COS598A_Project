    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

What specific areas of your life do you feel like you're not making progress in, or what goals do you feel like you're not meeting?

Would it make you feel more fulfilled, more connected to others, or more confident in yourself?\n\nAlso, when you say you're \"going through the motions\" every day, can you give me an example of what that looks like for you? Is it feeling unenthusiastic about work, hobbies, or social activities that you normally enjoy?

Change can be really unsettling, especially when we're already feeling uncertain or unhappy. Can you tell me more about what specifically scares you about change? Is it the fear of the unknown, fear of failure, or something else?\n\nAlso, I want to gently explore the idea that maybe, just maybe, the thing that needs to change isn't necessarily something big and external, but rather something internal. Perhaps we can work together to identify some small, incremental changes you could make in your daily life or thought patterns that might help you start feeling more enthusiastic and engaged again.\n\nWhat do you think about that idea?

What specifically feels too hard about that? Is it the thought of putting in effort, the fear of failure, or something else?\n\nAlso, I want to ask, have you noticed any social withdrawal or avoidance of activities you normally enjoy because of how you're feeling?

But I want you to know that we can work together to break down that mountain into smaller, manageable steps.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention avoiding social interactions and activities because they feel like too much effort. Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed or anxious, it can be tempting to withdraw from the world and isolate ourselves. But I want to gently suggest that this might be perpetuating a cycle of loneliness and disconnection.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you think would happen if you did reach out to a friend or family member, or engaged in an activity that usually brings you joy? What's the worst-case scenario that's playing out in your mind, and how realistic is it?\n\nAlso, I want to ask, have you considered the possibility that your feelings of exhaustion and overwhelm might be related to some underlying thoughts or beliefs about yourself or your life? Sometimes, our emotions can be driven by unconscious patterns or self-criticisms that we're not even aware of. Would you be open to exploring this idea further with me?"

You mentioned earlier that seeing your friend get married made you feel like you're stuck in limbo, and that everyone around you seems to be moving forward with their lives while you're not. I'm wondering if there might be some underlying thoughts or beliefs about yourself that are contributing to these feelings of inadequacy.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you think is holding you back from pursuing your goals or feeling more fulfilled? Is it fear of failure, fear of success, or something else entirely? Are there any negative self-statements or critical inner voices that might be influencing your thoughts and behaviors?\n\nLet's work together to identify some of these patterns and see if we can start to challenge them.

And yeah, having a meaningful relationship would be great too... but it feels like everyone around me is already paired up, and I'm just stuck on the outside looking in.\n\n(sighs) As for things I've always wanted to try or achieve... I've always wanted to travel more and explore new places, but I've never had the courage to take the leap and do it. And I've also always wanted to learn how to play music, but I've never made the time for it. It's like I'm stuck in this rut and can't seem to break free.\n\n(looks up) Does that make sense? Or am I just being stupid and indecisive?"
