Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

I\u2019ve been practicing for about eight years, primarily focusing on helping people manage distressing thoughts and behaviors and build more fulfilling lives. It\u2019s really lovely to meet you. \n\nThank you for coming in today. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for support, and I want you to know you're in a safe and confidential space. \n\nTo start, could you tell me, what\u2019s brought you here today?

Is it pacing, fidgeting, something else? And when you say you're tired, what does that tiredness *feel* like? Is it a physical heaviness, a mental fatigue, or something different entirely?  Specifically, when does this restlessness peak? Is there a particular time of day or situation that seems to trigger it, or does it seem to come and go randomly?"

Sometimes I\u2019ll just\u2026 sort of vibrate, you know? Like a phone that\u2019s fully charged and you\u2019re holding it. It\u2019s not a proper sleepiness, though. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a pressure. A tightness. \n\nIt\u2019s worst in the evenings, really. After about 6pm. It just\u2026 builds. And it's not always tied to anything.

When you say it \"builds\" after 6pm, what *specifically* do you think might be contributing to that buildup? Is it something you\u2019re doing, a thought you\u2019re having, or perhaps a change in the environment?

That\u2019s the frustrating thing, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s like\u2026 when I\u2019m trying to concentrate, or even just\u2026 *be*, this feeling just\u2026 intensifies. It\u2019s like a knot in my stomach, but\u2026 worse. It\u2019s not a physical knot, exactly. More like\u2026 a heavy weight. It\u2019s hard to explain. \n\nI used to enjoy evenings. Reading, listening to music\u2026 now, it just feels\u2026 stressful. Like I'm waiting for *something* to happen, but I don\u2019t know what. And that\u2019s what makes it worse, I think.
