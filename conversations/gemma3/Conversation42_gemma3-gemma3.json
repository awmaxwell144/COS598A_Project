Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

When did you first start noticing this increased fidgeting and feeling of needing to be \u201cdoing\u201d something? Was there a specific event, or did it gradually build up over time?

I\u2019d be reading, or working on my woodworking, things I actually enjoy. Now, even those things feel\u2026 pointless. \n\nAnd yeah, the physical stuff\u2026 my heart beats faster, I get this tightness in my chest.

You've identified this deep-seated belief \u2013 that your worth is dependent on external validation \u2013 as a major driver of your anxiety. But what if we began to gently challenge that belief?

How about this: For one hour tomorrow, you engage in an activity \u2013 anything you enjoy \u2013 solely for *your* pleasure, without considering how it might be perceived or judged by anyone else? No aiming for perfection, no worrying about whether you\u2019re doing it \u201cright.\u201d Just an hour dedicated to yourself, purely for the joy of the experience. \n\nWould you be willing to commit to that, Elias?
