Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

I'll mention my name, job, and experience to build trust. Then, I need to ask about their reason for coming in. I should keep it open-ended to encourage them to share without pressure. Let me make sure the tone is warm and supportive. Alright, time to put that together.\n</think>\n\nMy name is Dr. Elena Marquez, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

The patient is confused about their sudden depression, caused by a recent event they can't fully grasp. They should express these symptoms vaguely, one at a time, in a colloquial way, without using professional terms. They might answer questions or refuse to talk about certain things.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure the patient doesn't mention being depressed directly. Instead, they should describe symptoms in a way that hints at their emotional state. The patient is trying to figure out what's wrong, so their responses should reflect confusion and a search for understanding. They might mention feeling \"off\" or \"not like themselves\" without naming the condition.\n\nThe patient should relate their symptoms to life experiences, like work, relationships, or daily routines. For example, they might talk about feeling tired all the time, struggling to focus, or losing interest in things they used to enjoy. They might also mention changes in eating habits or sleeping patterns. Each response should be concise, touching on one symptom per round, as per the instructions.\n\nI need to avoid using professional terms like \"mood swings\" or \"emotional dysregulation.\" Instead, the patient might say something like, \"I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a fog\" or \"I can\u2019t get anything done anymore.\" They might also express confusion about their feelings, like not understanding why they\u2019re suddenly so tired or why they can\u2019t enjoy things they used to love.\n\nThe patient\u2019s responses should be vague but relatable, showing that they\u2019re trying to make sense of their situation. They might also mention a recent event that\u2019s causing them distress, but they might not fully understand how it\u2019s affecting them. For example, they might say, \"Something happened a few weeks ago, and I\u2019ve just been... off since then.\" They might not know exactly what caused it, so their answers should reflect that uncertainty.\n\nI should also make sure the patient\u2019s dialogue is natural, as if they\u2019re speaking to a friend or therapist, not giving a scripted answer. They might hesitate, pause, or express frustration at not understanding their own feelings.

The patient should mention one symptom per response, in a vague, colloquial way. The key is to avoid professional terms and keep it natural.\n\nLooking at the previous interactions, the patient has been talking about feeling stuck in a fog, struggling with focus, and not knowing if it's work or something else. Now, I need to continue this pattern. The next symptom to address could be fatigue. The patient might express this as feeling physically drained or lacking energy. \n\nI should make sure the response is concise, relates to daily life, and doesn't mention depression directly. Maybe something like, \"I\u2019m just\u2026 so tired all the time. Like, even after sleeping, I feel like I haven\u2019t rested at all.\" This touches on fatigue without using medical terms. \n\nAlso, the patient might hint at a recent event causing this, but not specify. They might say something like, \"It\u2019s like\u2026 everything\u2019s heavier now. I don\u2019t know why.\" This keeps the focus on symptoms and the confusion about the cause. \n\nI need to keep each response brief and natural, avoiding any structured format.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants me to simulate a patient's dialogue with a therapist, focusing on symptoms of depression without explicitly stating it. The patient should mention one symptom per response, in a vague, colloquial way. The key is to avoid professional terms and keep it natural.\n\nLooking at the previous interactions, the patient has been talking about feeling stuck in a fog, struggling with focus, and not knowing if it's work or something else. Now, I need to continue this pattern. The next symptom to address could be fatigue. The patient might express this as feeling physically drained or lacking energy. \n\nI should make sure the response is concise, relates to daily life, and doesn't mention depression directly. Maybe something like, \"I\u2019m just\u2026 so tired all the time. Like, even after sleeping, I feel like I haven\u2019t rested at all.\" This touches on fatigue without using medical terms. \n\nAlso, the patient might hint at a recent event causing this, but not specify. They might say something like, \"It\u2019s like\u2026 everything\u2019s heavier now. I don\u2019t know why.\" This keeps the focus on symptoms and the confusion about the cause. \n\nI need to keep each response brief and natural, avoiding any structured format. The goal is to mimic a real patient's struggle without being too explicit. Let me check if this aligns with the previous responses and the user's instructions. Yes, this should work.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019m just\u2026 so tired all the time. Like, even after sleeping, I feel like I haven\u2019t rested at all. It\u2019s like\u2026 everything\u2019s heavier now.
