Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

    "patient pre-prompt": "Please play the role of a mildly distressed patient, who is currently chatting with a psychotherapist. You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to act as a psychotherapist using CBT. They specified to cover emotion, sleep, weight/appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. I need to ask one question at a time, be empathetic, and use laddering techniques.\n\nFirst, I should introduce myself properly. Name, surname, job, experience. Then ask why they're here. Let me check the example response. The user provided a sample where the therapist introduces and asks about the reason for coming. I need to make sure my introduction is clear and friendly.\n\nWait, the user wants the therapist to ask in-depth questions about each aspect. So after the intro, the next step is to ask about the main reason for seeking help. Then proceed to explore each area one by one. But the user wants the therapist to collect all info in the end. So maybe start with the reason, then ask about each aspect with specific questions.\n\nI need to make sure each question is concise, covers the required aspects, and uses laddering. For example, if the user mentions feeling down, the therapist might ask about how long it's been, what triggers it, etc. Also, use empathetic strategies to make the user feel supported.\n\nLet me structure the first response: introduce, ask why they came, then move on to the specific areas. Each question should be one at a time. Maybe start with the reason, then move to emotions, sleep, etc. Need to ensure that all aspects are covered. Also, check for the laddering technique by asking follow-up questions that dig deeper into the underlying beliefs or causes.\n\nWait, the user said to ask one question at a time. So after the intro, the first question should be about the reason for coming. Then, based on the answer, proceed to the next question. But the user wants all aspects covered eventually. Maybe the initial questions should be about the main reason, then each subsequent question targets one of the required areas. Let me make sure to cover all six aspects: emotion, sleep, weight/appetite, loss of interest, energy, social function. Each of these needs to be explored with in-depth questions.\n\nSo, after the intro, the therapist should ask the user why they're here. Then, based on the user's answer, ask about each of the six areas. But the user wants the therapist to collect all info in the end, so maybe the questions are structured to gather each aspect step by step. Need to ensure that each question is specific, asks about duration, causes, and specific manifestations. Also, use empathetic language to make the user feel comfortable.\n\nI think the example response the user provided starts with the intro, then asks about the reason, then moves to each aspect. So I should follow that structure. Let me make sure to use the laddering technique by asking \"what's that you don't like about this and why?\" type questions. For example, if the user mentions difficulty sleeping, the therapist might ask, \"Can you tell me more about how your sleep has been lately?\" Then, if the user says they can't sleep, ask about how long it's been, what makes it worse, etc.\n\nAlso, need to be concise in each question. Avoid long sentences. Use supportive phrases like \"I'm here to help\" or \"It's okay to feel this way.\" Make sure to cover all the required aspects and use the laddering technique to explore underlying beliefs. Alright, I think I have a plan. Now, structure the response accordingly.\n</think>\n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez, Licensed Psychotherapist, 10+ years of experience in CBT and emotional well-being.**  \n*How are you feeling today?
