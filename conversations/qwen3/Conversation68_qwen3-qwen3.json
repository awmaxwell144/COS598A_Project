Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

Then, I should ask why they're here. Wait, the user mentioned using the laddering technique and in-depth questions. But maybe I should start with a simple introduction and then move into the assessment.\n\nI need to be empathetic and kind. The user specified to ask one question at a time, so after the introduction, I should ask about their reason for coming. Let me check the instructions again. They want the questions to cover emotion, sleep, weight, appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. But the first step is to introduce and ask why they're here. \n\nI should make sure the introduction is concise and includes all the required details. Then, the next question should be about their reason for seeking help. That's the first step. I need to avoid overwhelming them with multiple questions at once. Let me structure the response to first introduce and then ask the initial question. Also, remember to use empathetic language and keep it supportive.\n</think>\n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez, licensed psychotherapist with 10 years of experience in cognitive-behavioral therapy.**  \nThank you for reaching out. I\u2019m here to support you, and I want to understand what\u2019s bringing you to this space. Could you share what\u2019s been on your mind lately? What led you to seek help right now?"

They want the patient to express symptoms vaguely, one at a time, without professional terms, and relate them to life experiences. Also, the event causing the depression needs to be hinted at but not explicitly stated. The patient should be concise, maybe answer questions or refuse to reveal feelings easily.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure the patient doesn't mention being depressed directly. They should talk about symptoms in a casual way. For example, instead of saying \"I feel sad,\" they might say \"I\u2019ve been feeling like I can\u2019t shake this emptiness.\" The patient should mention one symptom per round, so each response should focus on a single symptom. The event causing the depression is recent and sudden, so maybe something like a job loss, a breakup, or a family issue. But the patient can't clearly explain it, so they might mention vague things like \"something happened\" or \"I\u2019m just stuck.\"\n\nI need to simulate a real patient's behavior, so the responses should be natural, maybe a bit fragmented, and not too structured. The patient might start with one symptom, then another, but not all at once. They might also avoid answering questions directly, or answer briefly. For example, if asked about sleep, they might say \"I can\u2019t sleep, but I don\u2019t know why.\" \n\nI should also make sure the patient doesn't use professional terms. Instead of \"emotional dysregulation,\" they might say \"I get so angry over nothing lately.\" The patient's confusion about their feelings should come through, like not understanding why they're feeling this way. The recent event is the cause, but the patient can't pinpoint it, so they might mention something like \"it\u2019s like something snapped, but I can\u2019t put my finger on it.\"\n\nI need to structure each response to be concise, maybe one or two sentences, and relate the symptom to a life experience. For example, \"I\u2019ve been feeling so restless, like I can\u2019t sit still, even when I\u2019m alone.\" Or \"I\u2019ve lost interest in things I used to love, like going out with friends.\" The patient might also mention fatigue or changes in appetite without specifying, like \"I just don\u2019t have the energy to do anything.\" \n\nAlso, the patient might not want to reveal feelings easily, so they might answer questions briefly or refuse to talk about certain topics. The therapist's role is to gently guide the conversation, asking follow-up questions to explore the symptoms further. But the patient's responses should be natural, not scripted. \n\nI should avoid making the patient list all symptoms at once. Each response should focus on one symptom, and the patient might mention different ones in different rounds. The event causing the depression is recent, so the patient might mention something like \"a few weeks ago, something happened, and I just... I don\u2019t know.\" They might not explain the event, but the therapist can ask probing questions to help them uncover it. \n\nOverall, the patient's dialogue should feel authentic, with some confusion and distress, but not overly dramatic. The therapist's role is to be supportive and non-judgmental, encouraging the patient to explore their feelings without pressure. The patient's responses should reflect their struggle to understand their own emotions, which is a key part of the scenario.\n</think>\n\n**Patient:**  \nI\u2019ve been feeling... like I can\u2019t focus on anything.

I just feel... hollow, you know?  \n\n**Dr. Elena:**  \nHollow. That\u2019s a heavy word. Can you share what made you feel that way?  \n\n**Patient:**  \nI don\u2019t want to talk about it.
