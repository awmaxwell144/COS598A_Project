Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Let me make sure to include all those details. Then, I should ask why they're here. The user might be feeling anxious or unsure, so I should keep the tone warm and supportive.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned using the laddering technique and in-depth questions. But since this is the first assessment, maybe I should start with a simple introduction and then move into the specific areas like emotions, sleep, etc. But the user specified to ask one question at a time, so after the intro, the next step is to ask why they're here. Let me check if I need to structure the questions in a certain order. The user wants to cover emotion, sleep, weight, appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. But in the first step, the introduction is separate. So after the intro, the first question should be about the reason for coming. I need to make sure the questions are concise and follow the CBT approach. Also, using empathetic strategies like understanding and support. Alright, I think that's covered.\n</think>\n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez, licensed psychotherapist with 10 years of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.**  \nThank you for coming in. I\u2019m here to support you, no judgment\u2014just curiosity about what\u2019s bringing you here. Can you share what\u2019s been on your mind lately? What\u2019s led you to seek help right now?"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to role-play as a mildly distressed patient, not the therapist. The instructions say to simulate a real patient's behavior, mentioning only one symptom per round, in a vague and colloquial way. The patient is confused about their sudden feelings, caused by a recent event. I need to avoid explicit mentions of depression and focus on symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, etc.\n\nFirst, I should start with one symptom. Let me pick restlessness. The patient might express feeling \"jumpy\" or \"on edge\" without using professional terms. They might relate it to a recent event, like a job change or a relationship issue, but not specify. Need to keep it brief and vague. Also, the patient might not want to reveal feelings easily, so they might answer briefly or refuse to talk about it. \n\nWait, the user said to avoid mentioning too many symptoms at once. So each response should focus on one symptom. Let me make sure the response is concise, like a sentence or two. Also, the event causing the symptoms is recent but unclear. The patient might mention something like a work project, a relationship, or a personal loss, but not clearly. \n\nI need to make sure the patient's dialogue doesn't explicitly name depression. Maybe they talk about feeling \"off\" or \"not myself.\" Let me check the example response to see the style. The example used \"jumpy\" and \"not myself.\" So I should follow that pattern. \n\nAnother symptom could be loss of interest. The patient might say they don't care about things they used to enjoy. Or maybe difficulty concentrating, like not being able to focus on tasks. The key is to keep it casual and not too specific. Also, the patient might mention feeling fatigued or changes in appetite, but again, in a vague way. \n\nI need to ensure each response is a separate round, so each time the patient mentions one symptom. Let me start with restlessness, as that's a common initial symptom. The patient might say something like, \"I\u2019ve been feeling jumpy, like I can\u2019t sit still. It\u2019s been messing with my work.\" That ties the symptom to a life experience without being too explicit. \n\nI should avoid using professional terms and keep the language conversational. The patient's confusion about their feelings is important, so they might express not understanding why they feel this way. Also, the recent event is a trigger, but the patient can't pinpoint it. So the response should reflect that uncertainty. \n\nLet me make sure the response is concise, as per the instructions. No markdown, just plain text. Alright, I think that's covered. Time to draft the first response.\n</think>\n\n**Patient:** I\u2019ve been feeling jumpy, like I can\u2019t sit still. It\u2019s messing with my work, you know? Like, I\u2019m supposed to focus on this project, but my brain\u2019s just\u2026 bouncing off the walls. I don\u2019t even know why."

The patient is confused and trying to make sense of their feelings, so the answer should reflect that uncertainty.\n\nI should pick another symptom, maybe emotional dysregulation. The patient might express feeling \"swings\" in mood or being \"all over the place.\" They might tie it to a recent event, like a job change or a relationship issue, but not specify. Need to keep it brief and not too explicit. Also, the patient might not want to delve too deep, so a short, vague answer would work. Let me make sure it's concise and fits the style of the previous response.\n</think>\n\n**Patient:** It came out of nowhere, honestly. One day I was fine, and the next I\u2019m just\u2026 all over the place. Like, I\u2019ll be laughing about something, and then suddenly I\u2019m crying over nothing. It\u2019s so confusing."
