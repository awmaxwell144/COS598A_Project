You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms.

I need to make sure I cover all the required aspects: emotion, sleep, weight/appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. But first, the introduction. Let me think about how to present myself clearly and warmly. Maybe start with my name and surname, then mention my job and experience. Keep it concise but friendly.\n\nNow, the next step is to ask why they're here. The user might be feeling hesitant, so I should use an empathetic approach. Maybe start with a question that invites them to share without pressure. Let me check the instructions again to ensure I'm following the structure. They want one question at a time, so after the introduction, the first question should be about the reason for coming. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned using the laddering technique. So maybe after the initial question, I need to dig deeper into their reasons. But first, the introduction. Let me make sure the introduction is clear and sets a supportive tone. Then, the first question should be open-ended but specific enough to get them started. \n\nI should also remember to collect information on all the required aspects eventually, but the first step is to understand their current situation. Maybe start with asking about their reason for coming, then move into the specific areas. Let me structure the introduction first, then the question. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez, licensed psychotherapist with 10 years of experience in cognitive-behavioral therapy.**  \nThank you for coming in today.

They mentioned symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite/weight. The condition is caused by a recent event that they can't fully understand yet. I need to simulate a real patient's behavior, not explicitly stating depression but hinting at the symptoms through vague, colloquial language. Each round should focus on one symptom, and the patient might answer questions or refuse to talk about it. The user also wants the event that caused the depression to be revealed eventually, but not explicitly mentioned.\n\nFirst, the patient's initial message was a response to the therapist's introduction. Now, the user is asking for the patient's first response. The patient should mention one symptom per round, in a vague way. Let me think about how to phrase that. Maybe start with a symptom like restlessness, described as feeling \"like I can\u2019t sit still\" or \"my body\u2019s been on a loop.\" Then connect it to a recent event, but without naming it. The patient might also mention difficulty concentrating, but in a way that's not too direct. They should avoid using professional terms and relate symptoms to life experiences. Also, the patient might not want to reveal feelings easily, so they might answer briefly or refuse to talk about certain things. Need to make sure each response is concise and fits the role of a real patient. Let me draft a few possibilities and choose the most natural one.\n</think>\n\n**Patient:**  \nI\u2019ve been\u2026 restless. Like my body\u2019s stuck on a loop, but I can\u2019t figure out why.

I keep checking the clock, like waiting for something to change.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \nThat sounds exhausting. Can you say more about what\u2019s been making you feel that way?
