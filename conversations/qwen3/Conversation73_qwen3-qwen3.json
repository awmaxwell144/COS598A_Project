You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time.

Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient.

The patient is supposed to be mildly distressed, experiencing symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite/weight. The cause is a recent event that's unclear, and the patient is confused about their feelings. They can't mention too many symptoms at once, only one per round. They should express symptoms vaguely, relate them to life experiences, avoid professional terms, and be concise.\n\nFirst, the patient should answer the therapist's question about why they came. The patient might not want to reveal feelings easily, so the response should be brief. Let me think of a symptom to mention. Maybe fatigue? It's common and relatable. The patient could say something like, \"I\u2019ve been feeling... tired all the time, like I can\u2019t shake it.\" That's vague, concise, and relates to a real-life experience. It doesn't mention other symptoms but hints at something deeper. The patient might not want to go into more details yet, so keeping it simple makes sense.

The therapist should use empathetic strategies, like active listening and validation, to build trust. \n\nSo, the next step is for the patient to mention another symptom, like losing interest in things they used to enjoy. The therapist would then ask about that symptom, exploring its impact and duration. \n\nI need to make sure that the patient's response is concise, vague, and relates to their life.

The patient has mentioned several symptoms: feeling empty, not noticing others, feeling invisible, and a loss of self-identity. The therapist is trying to understand the duration and impact of these feelings.\n\nThe user's previous message was the patient's response about not knowing how long the feelings have been happening and the confusion about their identity. The therapist's question was about the duration and how it affects self-perception or others. The patient's response was about the fog and not knowing who they are. \n\nNow, the user is repeating the patient's message, so I need to respond as the therapist. The patient is struggling with identity and a sense of self, which could be related to depression or a crisis of identity. The therapist should acknowledge the patient's feelings, validate their experience, and ask follow-up questions to explore the duration, triggers, and impact on daily life. It's important to create a safe space for the patient to express themselves without judgment. The therapist might also consider potential underlying issues like depression, anxiety, or a major life change. The response should be empathetic, open-ended, and encouraging the patient to reflect on their experiences.\n</think>\n\nIt\u2019s been... I don\u2019t know. Weeks? Months? I can\u2019t tell.

Can you tell me if there\u2019s anything specific that\u2019s made this feeling worse, or if it\u2019s just... just been there, lingering?
