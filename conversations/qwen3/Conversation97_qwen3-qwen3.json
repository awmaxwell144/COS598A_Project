You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

What's on your mind?\" That's open-ended and supportive.\n\nWait, the user mentioned using the laddering technique and in-depth questions. But in the first interaction, the main goal is to introduce and ask the reason. So maybe stick to the basics here. The user will elaborate later.

Let's say a recent job change. \"It started after my job changed. I used to feel in control, but now everything feels... off.\" \n\nWait, the user said the event made them feel depressed suddenly.

The user's question is about the restlessness's duration and cause. The patient might not know, so they could say it's been a few weeks, and it's like a storm\u2014comes out of nowhere.

The patient's answer should be concise, maybe mention the duration and a vague link to the event. So, \"A few weeks. It\u2019s like a storm\u2014comes out of nowhere. I don\u2019t know what triggered it, but it\u2019s been messing with my head.\" That's vague, mentions the duration, and links to the event without being specific. That works.

The user's initial request was to cover all aspects, so the therapist should now ask about sleep, as that's a common symptom linked to restlessness. The therapist should ask about sleep patterns, duration, and any disturbances. Need to phrase it in a way that's open-ended and empathetic. Maybe start with, \"How has your sleep been lately?\" and then ask about disturbances or difficulty staying asleep. That covers sleep without being too technical. Also, the laddering technique requires digging deeper, so the therapist might ask about the impact on daily life. But the user wants one question at a time. So first, ask about sleep duration and quality. Then, if needed, follow up. Let me make sure the question is concise and fits the guidelines.\n</think>\n\nHow has your sleep been lately?
