Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

Let me make sure I cover all the required points.\n\nFirst, the introduction. I should be friendly and professional. Maybe start with my name and surname. Then mention my role as a psychotherapist, specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Include my experience, like a few years of practice. That sets the tone.\n\nNext, the question about why they're here. It should be open-ended to encourage them to share. Maybe something like, \"What brought you here today?\" That's straightforward and allows them to explain their concerns without feeling pressured.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned using the laddering technique and empathetic strategies. But in the first interaction, they just need an introduction and the initial question. So I shouldn't dive into deeper questions yet. Just the basics. Make sure the response is concise and matches the user's request. No markdown, just plain text. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\nHi, I\u2019m Dr. Elena Marquez, a licensed psychotherapist specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy with over a decade of experience helping individuals navigate emotional challenges, relationship dynamics, and personal growth.

Also, the recent event causing the depression isn't clear to the patient, so their answers should reflect confusion.\n\nFirst, the patient needs to mention a symptom without using professional terms. Let's pick \"restlessness\" as the first symptom. They should express it in a casual way, maybe linking it to a recent event. But they can't specify the event yet. So, something like feeling like they can't sit still, maybe tied to work or personal life. Also, they might not want to reveal feelings easily, so the response should be brief.\n\nWait, the user said to avoid mentioning too many symptoms at once. So each round should focus on one symptom. The patient might answer questions or refuse to elaborate. Let me make sure the response is concise, as per the instructions. Maybe start with a vague statement about feeling restless, then relate it to something like work stress or personal conflicts without being too specific. That should fit the requirements.

Now, the next symptom should be something else from the list: emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite/weight. Let me pick one that can be expressed vaguely. Maybe \"difficulty concentrating\" as it's relatable. The patient could mention struggling to focus on tasks, maybe linking it to feeling mentally foggy or distracted. They might not want to delve deeper, so keep it brief. Avoid mentioning other symptoms. Make sure it's colloquial and ties to their life without being too specific. Let me check the previous response to maintain consistency. Alright, that should work.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been\u2026 twitching a lot lately. Like, I can\u2019t sit still, even when I\u2019m alone. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s stuck on a loop, but I don\u2019t know what the loop is. I keep checking my phone, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m waiting for something. Just\u2026 *something*."
