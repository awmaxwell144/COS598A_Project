You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Then ask why they're here.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned using the laddering technique and in-depth questions about specific aspects like emotions, sleep, weight, etc. But first, the introduction and the initial question. Let me make sure I follow the structure correctly.\n\nI should start with a friendly introduction, maybe something like \"Hello, I'm Dr. Emily Carter, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy. I'm here to support you through this process.\" Then ask, \"What brought you here today?\" to open the conversation.\n\nBut the user emphasized being concise and asking one question at a time. So after the intro, the next step is to ask why they're here. I need to make sure the introduction is clear and the question is open-ended to encourage them to share their concerns. Also, using empathetic language to make them feel comfortable. Let me check if I covered all the points: name, surname, job, experience, and the initial question. Yes, that's covered. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nHello, I\u2019m Dr. Emily Carter, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

The patient is supposed to be mildly distressed, experiencing symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, etc., but not explicitly mention depression. They should talk about one symptom per round, in a vague and colloquial way, relating it to life experiences without using professional terms. Also, the patient is confused about the sudden depression caused by a recent event, which they can't fully understand yet.\n\nFirst, the therapist asked, \"What brought you here today?\" The patient needs to respond with one symptom, maybe something like restlessness. They should express it in a casual way, like feeling \"on edge\" or \"like I can't sit still.\" They might mention how it's affecting their daily life, like work or social interactions. They should avoid mentioning other symptoms at once and keep it concise. Also, they might not want to reveal too much, so the response should be brief. The patient should also hint at the recent event causing this, but not specify what it is. Let me make sure the response fits all these criteria: one symptom, vague, colloquial, related to life, and a hint at the event without naming it. Alright, time to draft the response.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling\u2026 restless, like I can\u2019t sit still. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s stuck on a loop, but I don\u2019t know what the loop is. I keep checking my phone, even when I don\u2019t need to. It\u2019s exhausting."

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is simulating a patient's response to a therapist's question. The patient is talking about restlessness, feeling like their body is stuck in a loop, and checking their phone a lot. The therapist needs to ask follow-up questions to explore this symptom in depth.\n\nFirst, the therapist should focus on the duration of the restlessness. How long has this been going on? The patient mentioned it's been a few weeks, so the therapist can ask about the timeline. Next, the therapist should explore the specific manifestations of the restlessness. What does it feel like physically or emotionally? The patient described checking their phone, so the therapist might ask about other behaviors or thoughts that accompany it. \n\nThen, the therapist should connect this to the recent event the patient mentioned. The patient hinted at a recent event causing this, so the therapist can ask about any life changes or stressors in the past month. It's important to use empathetic language to make the patient feel understood. The therapist should also check if the restlessness is affecting other areas of life, like work or relationships, which ties into the CBT aspects of social function and energy. \n\nThe therapist needs to ask one question at a time, ensuring each question is concise and allows the patient to elaborate. The goal is to gather information on all the required aspects: emotion, sleep, weight/appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. Using the laddering technique, the therapist should ask increasingly specific questions to uncover underlying beliefs or triggers. For example, asking why the phone-checking behavior feels necessary or what the patient might be avoiding by staying restless. \n\nIt's also important to maintain a supportive tone, encouraging the patient to feel comfortable sharing without judgment. The therapist should avoid using professional jargon and keep the conversation natural. By systematically addressing each symptom and its context, the therapist can build a comprehensive understanding of the patient's experience, which is essential for effective CBT. \n\nFinally, the therapist should ensure that all aspects are covered, even if the patient hasn't mentioned them yet. For instance, if the patient hasn't talked about sleep or appetite, the therapist might gently bring those up in subsequent questions. The key is to be thorough but not overwhelming, allowing the patient to feel supported throughout the process.\n</think>\n\nHow long has this restlessness been happening? And what makes it feel like you\u2019re stuck in a loop\u2014like, what\u2019s the trigger or pattern you notice?"

But they can't mention depression directly. Instead, they could say something like, \"It started after everything changed at work.\" They might mention feeling disconnected or unable to focus, which ties into the symptoms listed. The therapist needs to ask follow-up questions to explore the event's impact on the patient's daily life and emotions. The key is to keep the conversation flowing naturally, avoiding professional terms and staying vague.
