Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

The event causing the symptoms is recent but unclear.\n\nLooking at the previous interaction, the patient mentioned feeling stuck, mental drifting, physical heaviness, and a racing mind. The therapist asked about sleep. Now, the patient's response needs to address sleep in a vague way. The user's example response was about lying awake and not feeling rested. I need to make sure the patient's answer is concise, colloquial, and doesn't mention depression explicitly. The patient might also refuse to talk about it. Let me think of a natural way to express sleep issues without using medical terms. Maybe something like, \"I\u2019ve been lying awake for hours, but when I do fall asleep, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not really there. I wake up feeling like I haven\u2019t slept at all. It\u2019s\u2026 frustrating.\" That's vague, relates to sleep, and doesn't use professional terms. It also conveys the feeling of not being rested. Let me check if that fits the pattern. Yes, it's concise and fits the patient's perspective. Alright, that should work.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been lying awake for hours, but when I do fall asleep, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not really there. I wake up feeling like I haven\u2019t slept at all.
