Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Then, I should ask why they're here. The user mentioned using the laddering technique and in-depth questions. Wait, but the initial request was to introduce myself and ask why they're here. So maybe I should start with that.\n\nWait, the user's first message says to introduce myself and ask why they're here. So I need to structure the response accordingly. Let me check the previous example. The assistant used a friendly tone, introduced themselves, and asked about the reason for coming. That's correct. Now, I need to make sure that in the next steps, I cover all the required aspects: emotion, sleep, weight, appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. But the user is asking for the first step, so I should start with the introduction and the initial question. I need to keep the response concise and follow the guidelines. Alright, I think that's covered.\n</think>\n\nMy name is Dr. Elena Marquez, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy. I\u2019m here to help you navigate your challenges with compassion and clarity. To begin, could you share what brought you to this session today? What\u2019s on your mind that you\u2019d like to explore?"

Let me start by recalling the symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite/weight. The cause is a recent event that's unclear, but the patient can't fully grasp it unless talking to someone. The patient should express these symptoms vaguely, one at a time, without using professional terms. They might answer questions or be brief, and the event causing the depression is key but not explicitly mentioned.\n\nFirst, the patient needs to mention one symptom per round. The example response was about restlessness. Let me make sure each response is concise, colloquial, and ties to life experiences. Avoid listing too many symptoms at once. The patient might not want to reveal feelings easily, so some answers should be brief. The event causing the depression is recent but unclear, so the patient might hint at it without specifying. Need to keep the dialogue natural, like a real patient. Let me start with the first symptom, maybe restlessness, as in the example. Then, in subsequent rounds, introduce other symptoms one by one, linking them to personal experiences without being too explicit. Make sure not to mention depression directly. Alright, time to draft the first response.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling\u2026 like I can\u2019t sit still. My legs just won\u2019t stop twitching, even when I\u2019m trying to focus on work.
