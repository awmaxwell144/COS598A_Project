You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms.

Need to ask one question at a time, in-depth, using laddering techniques. Also, empathetic strategies like understanding and support.\n\nFirst, the user asked for an introduction. I should start by introducing myself as Dr. Lena Carter, a licensed therapist with 10 years of experience. Then ask why they're here. But the user's next message is the initial assessment. Wait, the user's first message was the introduction request. The assistant's response was correct. Now the user's next input is the initial assessment. Wait, the user might be following up. Let me check the history again.\n\nWait, the user's first message was the initial request. The assistant responded with the introduction. Now the user is continuing the conversation. The user's next input is the initial assessment. Wait, maybe the user is asking for the first question. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, the user's first message was the initial request to introduce and ask why they're here. The assistant responded with the introduction and the question. Now, the user's next message is the actual assessment. So, the user is responding to the initial question. The assistant needs to ask the first question. Wait, the user hasn't provided their answer yet. Wait, the user might be the one who is the client, and the assistant is the therapist. The user's first message is the initial request. The assistant introduced themselves and asked why the user is here. Now the user's next message is the actual assessment, which is the client's response. Wait, maybe the user is the client, and the assistant is the therapist. The user's first message was the initial request, and the assistant responded with the introduction and the first question.

Maybe the user is just starting the session, so the assistant needs to ask the first question. Wait, the user's first message was the initial request. The assistant responded with the introduction and the question. Now the user's next message is the actual assessment. Wait, I think I need to clarify. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nThe user's first message was: \"Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy).

They mentioned symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite/weight. The patient is confused about their feelings and can't pinpoint the cause, which is a recent event.\n\nI need to make sure the patient doesn't mention too many symptoms at once. Each response should focus on one symptom, expressed in a vague, colloquial way. The patient should relate their symptoms to life experiences without using professional terms. They might answer questions or refuse to talk about certain things. Also, the patient should be concise and not too direct.\n\nThe user is a therapist, so their response should be supportive and open-ended, encouraging the patient to explore their feelings. The patient's responses should reflect confusion and a sense of being stuck, without explicitly naming depression. The recent event is a key point, but the patient can't clearly understand it, so they might mention something vague like a change in their life or a relationship issue.\n\nI need to ensure that the patient's dialogue flows naturally, with each response focusing on a different symptom or feeling. The therapist's role is to gently guide the conversation, offering support and understanding without pushing too hard. The patient's responses should feel authentic, as if they're struggling to put their feelings into words.\n\nAlso, the patient might not want to reveal too much, so their answers should be brief or hesitant. The therapist should acknowledge this and offer reassurance. The patient's symptoms should be mentioned in a way that's relatable, using everyday language and situations. For example, instead of saying \"I can't concentrate,\" they might say \"I keep getting distracted by things that don\u2019t matter.\"\n\nI need to avoid any professional jargon and keep the conversation grounded in the patient's personal experience. The therapist's responses should be empathetic and non-judgmental, creating a safe space for the patient to share. The patient's confusion about the cause of their feelings should come through, showing that they're trying to make sense of their situation but aren't sure where to start.\n\nFinally, the patient's dialogue should reflect a sense of being overwhelmed and stuck, with each symptom mentioned in a way that feels natural and unforced.
