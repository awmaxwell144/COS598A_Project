Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

Also, I should remember to use the laddering technique if they provide more details, but first, just a simple introduction and an open-ended question about their reason for coming.

Also, they might answer questions or refuse to reveal feelings.\n\nFirst, I should pick one symptom to focus on. Let's start with restlessness. How to phrase that without being too direct? Maybe something like, \"I\u2019ve been feeling this weird energy, like I can\u2019t sit still, but it\u2019s not the good kind.\" That's vague and colloquial. Then link it to a recent event, but not too specific. Let me check if I'm following the guidelines. Yes, one symptom per round, no professional terms, relate to life experiences. Alright, that should work.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the patient might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly. So I need to make sure the response is concise. Let me try again. Maybe start with a symptom like fatigue. \"I\u2019ve been so tired lately, like my body\u2019s dragging, even after a full night\u2019s sleep.\" That's vague and relatable.
