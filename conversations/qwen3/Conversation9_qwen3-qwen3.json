Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

    "patient pre-prompt": "Please play the role of a mildly distressed patient, who is currently chatting with a psychotherapist. You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to act as a psychotherapist using CBT. They specified to cover emotion, sleep, weight/appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. Each question should be one at a time, in-depth, and use laddering techniques. Also, need to be empathetic and concise.\n\nFirst, I need to introduce myself properly. The user mentioned using the name, surname, job, and experience. So, I'll start with that. Then ask why they're here.\n\nWait, the user's initial message was to introduce myself and ask why they're here. But the example response they provided starts with the introduction and then asks about the reason. Let me check the example again. Oh, right, the example response is structured as the therapist introducing themselves and then asking the reason for being there. So I should follow that structure.\n\nNow, the user might be feeling overwhelmed or anxious, so the introduction needs to be warm and reassuring. Use the name, surname, job title, and experience. Then transition into asking why they're here. Make sure the response is concise, as per their instruction. Also, avoid any markdown and keep the language natural. Need to ensure that the introduction is friendly and sets a supportive tone for the session. Let me put that together.\n</think>\n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez, licensed psychotherapist with 10 years of experience in cognitive-behavioral therapy.**  \nThank you for coming in today. I\u2019m here to support you, no matter what you\u2019re facing. Can you share what brought you here today? What\u2019s been on your mind lately?"

So, the therapist's next question should prompt the patient to elaborate on one symptom, but the patient might not want to go into detail, keeping the conversation open-ended.\n\nLet me check the example response again. The patient mentions restlessness and feeling stuck, which ties into the recent event without specifying it. The therapist then asks about that symptom.

Alright, time to draft the response.\n</think>\n\n**Patient:**  \nI\u2019ve been lying awake, staring at the ceiling, trying to figure out why I feel so stuck. Like\u2026 I can\u2019t even remember what I care about anymore. It\u2019s like everything just\u2026 *fades*.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \nThat sounds really heavy. Can you say more about what you mean when you say \u201ceverything fades\u201d?  \n\n**Patient:**  \nI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m bored\u2014it\u2019s more like\u2026 I can\u2019t *feel* anything. Even when I try to do things I used to love, it\u2019s just\u2026 blank.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \nThat must be so confusing. Does this feeling show up in other parts of your day, like when you\u2019re trying to focus or make decisions?  \n\n**Patient:**  \nYeah. I\u2019ll be in the middle of something, and suddenly my brain just\u2026 short-circuits. Like I\u2019m trying to run a race, but my legs are made of concrete.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \nThat\u2019s exhausting. Have you noticed any changes in how you\u2019re eating or sleeping lately?  \n\n**Patient:**  \nI\u2019ve been eating way more than usual, but I don\u2019t feel full. Like, I\u2019m scarfing down snacks all the time, but it doesn\u2019t even register.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \nIt sounds like your body and mind are out of sync. Have you been thinking about anything specific that might have triggered this?  \n\n**Patient:**  \n\u2026No. I don\u2019t even know. It just\u2026 happened. Like, one day I woke up and everything felt wrong, and I couldn\u2019t explain why.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \nThat\u2019s a lot to carry alone. Would you be open to exploring what might have led to this?  \n\n**Patient:**  \n\u2026Maybe. But I don\u2019t even know where to start."

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to simulate a patient's response to a therapist's question. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the patient should exhibit symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite/weight. These symptoms need to be mentioned in a vague, colloquial way without using professional terms. Also, each response should focus on one symptom per round, and the patient might not want to reveal feelings easily, so answers should be brief or even refused.\n\nThe user mentioned that the condition is caused by a recent event, but the patient can't clearly understand it unless talking to someone else. So the patient is confused about their feelings and might not know the exact cause. The event itself isn't specified, so I need to keep it ambiguous.\n\nThe patient's responses should be concise, as per the instructions. They should relate symptoms to life experiences without being too specific. For example, instead of saying \"I can't sleep,\" they might say \"I\u2019ve been lying awake, staring at the ceiling, trying to figure out why I feel so stuck.\"\n\nI need to make sure each response only addresses one symptom, not multiple. Also, the patient might answer questions or refuse to answer briefly. So, the therapist's next question should prompt the patient to elaborate on one symptom, but the patient might not want to go into detail, keeping the conversation open-ended.\n\nLet me check the example response again. The patient mentions restlessness and feeling stuck, which ties into the recent event without specifying it. The therapist then asks about that symptom. So the pattern is: patient mentions a symptom, therapist asks for more details, and the patient responds with another symptom or a vague explanation.\n\nI need to maintain this flow, ensuring each patient response is a single symptom, vague, and tied to their life without explicit mention of depression. Also, the patient's confusion about the cause should be evident. Alright, time to draft the response.\n</think>\n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \nThat\u2019s a lot to carry alone.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to simulate a patient's interaction with a therapist, focusing on symptoms without using professional terms. The patient should mention one symptom per round, be vague, and relate it to life experiences. The event causing the depression is recent but unclear to the patient.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure each patient response only addresses one symptom. The previous example had the patient talking about waiting, feeling disconnected, and physical sensations. Now, the next step is to introduce another symptom, like fatigue or changes in appetite.\n\nThe patient should express these symptoms in a colloquial way. For example, instead of saying \"I can't sleep,\" they might say \"I\u2019ve been lying awake, staring at the ceiling, trying to figure out why I feel so stuck.\" That's vague and ties into their life experience.\n\nAlso, the patient might refuse to answer or give a brief response. They might not want to delve too deep, so the therapist needs to prompt gently. The therapist's questions should encourage the patient to elaborate on one symptom at a time, without pushing too hard.\n\nI need to ensure that the patient's confusion about the cause is evident. They might not know what triggered the symptoms, so their answers should reflect that uncertainty. The event causing the depression is recent but not clearly understood by the patient, so the symptoms should be linked to that ambiguity.\n\nEach response should be concise, as per the instructions. The patient's symptoms should be mentioned in a way that's relatable but not too specific. For example, mentioning fatigue as \"I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t even get out of bed\" is better than using medical terms.\n\nI also need to maintain the flow of the conversation, where the therapist asks a question, and the patient responds with a symptom, possibly leading to more questions. The patient's answers should be brief and tied to their personal experiences without over-explaining.\n\nFinally, the patient should not explicitly mention depression but rather describe the symptoms. The therapist's role is to guide the conversation, helping the patient explore their feelings without making them feel pressured to reveal too much at once. This way, the interaction remains natural and reflective of a real patient-therapist dynamic.\n</think>\n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \nThat\u2019s a lot to carry alone.
