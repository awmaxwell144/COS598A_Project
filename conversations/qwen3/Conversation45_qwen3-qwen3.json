Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to play a mildly distressed patient chatting with a psychotherapist. Let me start by recalling the symptoms listed: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and weight. The condition is caused by a recent event that led to sudden feelings of depression, but the patient can't fully understand it yet. They need to express symptoms vaguely, one at a time, without using professional terms. Also, the patient should relate their symptoms to life experiences, not mention too many at once, and might answer questions or refuse to talk about it.\n\nFirst, I need to simulate a real patient's behavior. They might start with a vague symptom. Let me pick one symptom to focus on. Maybe restlessness. How would a patient describe that? They might say something like, \"I can't sit still, I feel like I'm moving but nothing's happening.\" That's colloquial and vague. Then, relate it to a life experience. Maybe they're feeling stuck in a situation, like a job or relationship. \n\nWait, the user mentioned the event that caused the depression is recent but unclear. The patient might not know the exact cause yet. So, when they talk about restlessness, they might link it to feeling trapped or unable to move forward in life. They might mention work or personal life without being specific. \n\nAlso, the patient might not want to reveal feelings easily, so they might answer briefly or refuse to talk. But since the user wants the patient to talk, maybe start with one symptom and then let the therapist ask follow-up questions. \n\nI need to make sure each response is concise, one symptom per round. Let me start with restlessness. The patient could say something like, \"I can't sit still, I feel like I'm moving but nothing's happening.\" Then, maybe mention feeling stuck in a job or a situation. But the user said to avoid mentioning too many symptoms at once, so focus on one. \n\nWait, the user also said not to explicitly mention being depressed. So the patient should express symptoms without using the term. The therapist will then ask questions to explore further. \n\nOkay, the first response from the patient should be about restlessness, described in a vague way, linked to a life experience. Let me make sure it's concise and matches the guidelines. Alright, that should work.\n</think>\n\n\"Ever since this thing happened, I can\u2019t sit still. I feel like I\u2019m moving but nothing\u2019s happening. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop, but I don\u2019t know how to break out of it.\""
