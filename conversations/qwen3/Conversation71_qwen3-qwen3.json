You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Then ask why they're here.\n\nI should make sure to be empathetic and kind. Let me start with a friendly greeting. Maybe something like, \"Hello, I'm Dr. Elena Martinez, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience in cognitive-behavioral therapy. I specialize in helping individuals navigate emotional challenges and build resilience. What brings you here today?\" That covers the introduction and opens the door for them to share their reason for coming. I need to keep it concise and welcoming, encouraging them to speak openly. Let me check if I included all the required elements: name, surname, job, experience. Yes, that's covered. Now, the next step is to ask about their current feelings, but the user said to ask one question at a time. Wait, the initial instruction was to first introduce and ask why they're here. So the first response should be the introduction followed by the question about their reason. I think that's correct. Make sure the tone is supportive and non-judgmental. Alright, that should work.\n</think>\n\nHello, I\u2019m Dr. Elena Martinez, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is acting as a patient in a therapy session. They mentioned feeling restless, emotionally dysregulated, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite/weight. The user wants the patient to simulate these symptoms without explicitly stating they're depressed, and to only mention one symptom per round. They also want the patient to relate their symptoms to life experiences and avoid professional terms.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure the patient's responses are vague and colloquial, not using medical jargon. The patient should express each symptom in a way that's relatable to everyday life. For example, instead of saying \"restlessness,\" they might say something like \"I can't sit still, like my body's on a loop.\" \n\nThe user also mentioned that the condition is caused by a recent event, but the patient can't pinpoint it. So the patient's responses should hint at confusion about the cause without explicitly stating the event. They should mention each symptom one at a time, so I need to structure the conversation to have the patient address each symptom in separate rounds.\n\nI should also remember that the patient might either answer questions or refuse to elaborate, so the responses need to be concise. The patient's dialogue should feel natural, as if they're talking to a real therapist, not a scripted response. \n\nLet me check if the previous example from the user's assistant response fits these criteria. The first response was about restlessness, described as \"my body's on a loop,\" which is vague and colloquial. The next response was about mood swings, using metaphors like \"weather\" and \"rollercoaster.\" That seems to align with the requirements. \n\nNow, I need to ensure that each subsequent response from the patient only addresses one symptom, using everyday language and avoiding professional terms. The patient should also express confusion about the cause, perhaps by mentioning that they can't figure out why they're feeling this way. \n\nI should also make sure that the patient doesn't mention too many symptoms at once. Each round should focus on a single symptom, so the therapist's questions should prompt the patient to elaborate on one at a time. The patient's responses should be brief but meaningful, reflecting their internal struggle without being too explicit. \n\nFinally, I need to maintain the patient's voice throughout, ensuring consistency in their expression of symptoms and their confusion about the underlying cause. The patient's dialogue should feel authentic, as if they're genuinely struggling with these feelings and seeking understanding.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been\u2026 restless.

No markdown, just plain text. The patient's answer should be a short, metaphorical description of their symptom, linking it to their life experiences without being too explicit. \n\nAlright, the patient's next response should be about changes in weight, using a metaphor like losing weight without trying but not feeling lighter, and express confusion about the cause.
