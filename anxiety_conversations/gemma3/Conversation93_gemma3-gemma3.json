Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, irritability, excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and somatic complaints (like stomach discomfort or headaches). This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

Can you tell me a bit more about *when* you notice this fidgeting most strongly? Is it at particular times of the day, in certain situations, or is it fairly constant? And when you say \u201cbouncing off the walls,\u201d can you describe what that *feels* like specifically? What sensations are you experiencing alongside this restlessness?"

When you feel this pressure in your chest, can you tell me what *specifically* makes it worse? Are there certain thoughts or images that come to mind when you notice it?

When you say you \u201cjust want it to go away,\u201d what do you imagine would happen *if* that feeling disappeared? What would be the impact on you, and why do you think that would be so desirable? What is that you don't like about this feeling sitting there and why?"

It\u2019s incredibly brave of you to articulate the core of this fear - the loss of a loved one, and the profound anxiety stemming from the unknown. It sounds like this fear of sudden loss is deeply intertwined with a fundamental need for security and predictability.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that a little further. When you imagine this loss occurring, can you describe the *specific* emotions you experience alongside the fear? Is there sadness, grief, perhaps anger, or something else? And what is that you don\u2019t like about experiencing those emotions and why?"

    "role": "patient",
    "content": "Okay. Thank you for sharing that.

Are you replaying past conversations, wondering if you could have done something differently, or are you simply trying to make sense of the inexplicable?

When you replay past conversations or moments, what\u2019s the *underlying* message you\u2019re trying to communicate to yourself? Are you telling yourself, \u201cI need to be more careful,\u201d or \u201cI need to protect myself,\u201d or perhaps something else entirely? And what is that you don\u2019t like about this need to control those things and why?"

    "role": "patient",
    "content": "That\u2019s a really insightful observation \u2013 recognizing that the rumination isn\u2019t about genuinely trying to learn from the past, but rather a way to maintain a sense of control in a situation where you feel powerless. It\u2019s like a protective mechanism, isn\u2019t it? \n\nLet\u2019s explore that protective impulse a little more. Can you identify *what* specifically feels uncontrollable in your life right now? Is it a relationship, a job, a situation \u2013 or is it more of a general feeling of being at the mercy of external forces? And what is that you don\u2019t like about this feeling of being at the mercy of these forces and why?"

Not just disappointment in yourself, but disappointment in the world, in people, in the very nature of things. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re carrying a heavy burden of expectation \u2013 a desire for things to be good, for things to go right, and a profound fear of that not happening. And what is that you don\u2019t like about that need to maintain such high expectations and why?"
  },

If you could, in one sentence, describe the core of what you're experiencing \u2013 the feeling of anxiety, the restlessness, the fear of loss, and the pressure to maintain high expectations. What would that sentence be?"

    "role": "patient",
    "content": "That\u2019s a fantastic summation. I\u2019d say it\u2019s this: \u201cI\u2019m constantly bracing myself against a perceived threat of disappointment, which fuels a cycle of anxiety and prevents me from fully experiencing the present moment.\u201d\n\nHow does that resonate with you? Do you feel like that accurately captures the essence of what you\u2019ve been describing?"
