When you say you\u2019re \u201cbouncing off the walls,\u201d can you tell me a bit more about *what* that feels like physically?  Specifically, are there any particular physical sensations you notice when you're experiencing this heightened state \u2013 things like restlessness, agitation, or perhaps a feeling of being on edge?
