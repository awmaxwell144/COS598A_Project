Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, irritability, excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and somatic complaints (like stomach discomfort or headaches). This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

It\u2019s wonderful to meet you, and I want to assure you that this is a safe and confidential space for us to explore what\u2019s going on. \n\nTo start, could you tell me a little bit about what\u2019s been making you feel anxious or uneasy lately? Just start wherever feels most natural for you."

It\u2019s completely understandable that this is upsetting you and impacting your relationship. \n\nLet's focus on this pacing and fidgeting. Can you tell me a little more about *when* this happens most intensely? Is it consistently throughout the day, or are there particular times or situations that seem to trigger it? And when you\u2019re pacing, what specifically are you doing \u2013 is it just walking, or are you doing other things like tapping your feet, or picking at something?  Let\u2019s start with the frequency \u2013 approximately how often do you find yourself pacing in a typical day?"

Like, I\u2019ll be reading, or watching TV, and suddenly I\u2019m just\u2026 moving. It\u2019s like a current, pulling me around. I\u2019d say\u2026 maybe six, seven times an hour, on average.

Are you noticing any other sensations \u2013 perhaps tension in your muscles, a quickening of your heart rate, sweating, or anything like that?

It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a 6, I think. Maybe a 7 if I really concentrate on it. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. It\u2019s not painful, just\u2026 present. It\u2019s hard to shake."
