Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

When you feel this \u2018on edge,\u2019 what exactly do you notice happening in your body?  Specifically, could you describe the intensity \u2013 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being barely noticeable and 10 being the most intense you\u2019ve ever felt \u2013 and then tell me *what* you\u2019re experiencing?

I\u2019d say maybe a 6, sometimes a 7 if I\u2019m really concentrating on it. Like a pressure. And I\u2019ve been getting these headaches too. Dull ones. Not really throbbing, just\u2026 persistent."

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m actively *thinking* about anything specific, but it\u2019s just\u2026 a constant buzz. And then I feel exhausted when I wake up. It\u2019s just\u2026 draining."
