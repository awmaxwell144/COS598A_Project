You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

It's a fantastic example of how language can be used to create a sense of overwhelming nothingness. \n\nHere's what it represents, beyond just a silly exercise:\n\n*   **Existential Dread:** The sheer repetition mirrors the feeling of being trapped in a meaningless routine, or a situation where you feel like your actions have no real impact.\n*   **Loss of Identity:**  When you repeat the same phrase over and over, you lose track of what you're saying, and eventually, you lose your sense of self.\n*   **The Absurd:** It highlights the inherent absurdity of existence \u2013 the idea that life can sometimes feel random and without purpose.\n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant, if exhausting, demonstration of language\u2019s power.
