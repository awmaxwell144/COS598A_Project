Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

Specifically, could you describe the frequency \u2013 roughly, how many times a day do you find yourself fidgeting? And when you say \"driving me crazy,\" what specifically does that feeling feel like in your body?  Is it a general feeling of unease, or can you pinpoint any particular physical sensations?"

Could you describe that pressure \u2013 what does it *feel* like on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being barely noticeable and 10 being the most intense you\u2019ve ever felt?

When you feel that warmth, what else do you notice? Are there any other sensations \u2013 sounds, smells, anything \u2013 that you\u2019re aware of in this moment alongside the warmth? Just\u2026 notice what\u2019s present for you. There\u2019s no need to analyze it, just observe."
