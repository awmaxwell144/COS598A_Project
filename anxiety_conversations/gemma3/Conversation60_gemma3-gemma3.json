You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why.

Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

You\u2019ve described this feeling of \u201ceverything falling apart\u201d and the associated sense of vulnerability.

It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re preemptively punishing yourself for feeling \u2018less than\u2019 in those moments.\n\nLet's talk about that feeling of \u2018punishment\u2019. Can you describe what that 'punishment' *feels* like, physically and emotionally, when you imagine yourself feeling vulnerable? Is it a specific sensation \u2013 perhaps a tightness in your chest, a surge of shame, a feeling of coldness \u2013 or is it a more diffuse sense of discomfort and distress?

It\u2019s a very common pattern, and recognizing it is the first crucial step.\n\nLet\u2019s explore this further. You\u2019ve described a sense of \u2018punishment\u2019 \u2013 a feeling of withdrawing, of shrinking away from the experience of vulnerability. What *specifically* do you think you\u2019re trying to protect yourself *from* by engaging in this self-punitive behavior? What's the core fear that's driving this reaction?

If you could, just for a moment, silence that inner critic \u2013 that voice telling you to suppress vulnerability \u2013 what would be different? What would you allow yourself to *feel* without judgment, without the pressure to \u2018fix\u2019 it or \u2018get through\u2019 it? What\u2019s the permission you need to give yourself?"

Can you identify a specific *relationship* in your life where this need for external validation is particularly strong? Perhaps a relationship where you feel particularly vulnerable to judgment or criticism?

What\u2019s one small, achievable action you could take this week \u2013 just one tiny step \u2013 to begin shifting your focus from seeking external approval to accepting and valuing yourself, regardless of how you\u2019re feeling or what others think? Perhaps something as simple as saying \"no\" to a request that you don't truly want to fulfill, or perhaps a brief moment of self-compassion when you notice yourself engaging in self-critical thoughts. What feels manageable for you right now?"
