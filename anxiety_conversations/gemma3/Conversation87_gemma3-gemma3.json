Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Just tell me whatever comes to mind, even if it feels a little difficult to articulate. There\u2019s no right or wrong answer here."

Could you describe it for me? When you say \u201cconstantly,\u201d can you tell me a little more about *what* you're experiencing? For example, is it primarily physical \u2013 perhaps a feeling of jitteriness or agitation \u2013 or more of a mental experience, like a racing thought process?

It\u2019s clear this is significantly impacting your daily life.\n\nLet\u2019s delve a little deeper into this physical sensation. When you say you feel like you're vibrating, can you pinpoint the location of this sensation within your body? Is it more concentrated in your chest, your hands, your stomach, or somewhere else? And could you rate the intensity of this vibration on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is no sensation at all and 10 is the most intense you can imagine?"

When it gets really bad, it feels like it\u2019s spreading. It\u2019s hard to describe. It just *is*.\n\nI keep thinking about\u2026 things. Just\u2026 random things.

When you say you \u201cdon\u2019t want people to see you as a failure,\u201d what does \u201cfailure\u201d actually *mean* to you? What's the absolute worst-case scenario that you're imagining if you *are* perceived as a failure?

But is it *absolutely certain* that this is how people will react? Or is it possible that, despite your fears, others might be understanding, supportive, or perhaps even acknowledge that mistakes happen \u2013 especially in a professional setting?
