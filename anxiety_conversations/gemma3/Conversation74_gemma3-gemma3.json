Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help, and I want to assure you that you\u2019re in a safe and supportive space here.\n\nTo start, could you tell me a little bit about what\u2019s been making you feel anxious or uneasy lately?

Is it in specific situations, or does it seem to pop up randomly throughout the day?

I\u2019m genuinely impressed with the depth of your exploration, and I appreciate you sharing that experience with me. \n\nLet\u2019s take a step back. You mentioned a lot of anxiety around anticipating negative outcomes, and the feeling of time slipping away.  It sounds like you're experiencing a really intense sense of overwhelm when thinking about the future. \n\nTo help me understand this more fully, I want to gently probe a bit deeper. \n\n**First, can you tell me, in your own words, what you perceive as the *primary* driver of these worries about the future?** (Pause for response)"
