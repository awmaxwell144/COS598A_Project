You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms.

Just describe what\u2019s been on your mind, and don\u2019t worry about making it perfect \u2013 just tell me what's been troubling you."

Is it consistent throughout the day, or do you notice it coming in waves? And when you say you're \"fidgeting,\" what does that actually *look* like? Are you tapping your feet, playing with your hair, clicking a pen, something else entirely?  Specifically, can you describe the movement itself \u2013 what does it *feel* like in your body?"

It\u2019s not\u2026 dramatic. Just\u2026 a lot of small movements. Mostly my hands. I\u2019ll be holding a pen, and I\u2019ll keep turning it over and over. Or my fingers will be drumming on the desk. It\u2019s\u2026 distracting. I try to stop, but it\u2019s like\u2026 a little current just pulls me back. It\u2019s worse in the evenings, I think.

It sounds like a very significant fear is driving a lot of this \u2013 the fear of losing your stability and feeling completely isolated.\n\nNow, let\u2019s just check in with you. On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is \u201cnot at all distressing\u201d and 10 is \u201cthe most distressing thing you can imagine,\u201d how would you rate the level of distress you\u2019re feeling right now, thinking about this possibility of being unemployed and alone?"

We've established that the thought of being unemployed and alone is profoundly distressing for you. But let\u2019s consider this: is it *absolutely certain* that this catastrophic outcome \u2013 losing your job and becoming homeless \u2013 *will* happen if you make a mistake?

It sounds like a deeply ingrained fear is at play here, and it\u2019s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge how strongly it\u2019s affecting you.\n\nLet\u2019s just take a moment. You mentioned that this thought \"keeps coming back.\" Can you tell me a little more about *when* you notice it returning?

Imagine you're experiencing that feeling of pressure and unease *before* the thought pops into your head. Just for a moment, try to identify what that initial feeling *is*. What does it *feel* like in your body? Is it a tightness in your chest? A knot in your stomach? A racing heart? Just notice it \u2013 don\u2019t try to change it, just observe.

You\u2019ve just identified a crucial element \u2013 that initial feeling of coldness and pressure *before* the thought arises. That\u2019s a really important piece of information. It suggests that this isn't just a random, intrusive thought; it\u2019s a signal from your body, alerting you to something \u2013 perhaps a build-up of anxiety \u2013 that you can potentially address.\n\nNow, let's practice a simple technique to help you manage that initial feeling. It\u2019s called \u201cgrounding.\u201d It\u2019s a way to bring you back to the present moment when you're feeling overwhelmed. We\u2019ll use your five senses. I\u2019m going to ask you to focus on something \u2013 *anything* \u2013 around you, and really notice it using all five of your senses.\n\nLet\u2019s start with\u2026 sight. Can you describe something you see right now, in as much detail as possible? Don't just say \"a chair.\" Tell me about the color of the chair, its shape, its texture... everything you notice visually. Take your time."

You\u2019ve just successfully used a grounding technique \u2013 focusing on your senses \u2013 to interrupt the cycle of anxiety. You\u2019ve created a small space of calm within yourself, a point of connection to the present moment.\n\nThis is a key skill, and it\u2019s one we can practice regularly. When you notice that feeling of coldness and pressure returning, or when you feel that anxiety building, I want you to immediately shift your focus to something \u2013 anything \u2013 using your five senses. Describe it to yourself, really notice it. It's a way to pull yourself back to the present and disrupt the flow of anxious thoughts.\n\nWould you like to practice this again, perhaps with a slightly different object, or would you like to talk a little more about what you're experiencing right now?"
