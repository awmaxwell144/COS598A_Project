You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",
