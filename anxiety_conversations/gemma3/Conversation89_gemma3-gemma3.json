Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

When you say you toss and turn at night, can you describe what that *feels* like specifically? Is it restlessness? Are you struggling to fall asleep, or do you wake up frequently? And could you describe the intensity of that feeling \u2013 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being a mild feeling of unease and 10 being the most intense anxiety you've ever experienced, where would you place it when you\u2019re tossing and turning?"

I just\u2026 move. And I feel\u2026 irritable. Really irritable. Small things bother me. Like, I snapped at my sister this morning over nothing. Which isn't normal. I\u2019d give it, maybe, a 6?

Let\u2019s unpack that a little further. You mentioned \u201ceveryone would judge me.\u201d What is it *specifically* about the *idea* of judgment that is so terrifying?

It\u2019s about feeling fundamentally flawed and unworthy. \n\nLet's explore that a little more. When you imagine being judged, what is the *feeling* associated with that judgment? Is it shame? Disappointment? Hurt?

When you imagine being judged and feeling that shame, can you describe the *specific* physical sensations you experience? Does it manifest as a tightness in your chest? A hot flush? A feeling of coldness? Or perhaps something else entirely? And on a scale of 1 to 10, how intense would you say that physical sensation would be *during* the moment of judgment?

Can you close your eyes for a moment and try to access that feeling again? Just focus on that tightness, that pressure\u2026 and describe it to me *now*, in detail. What color does it seem to be? Does it have a texture? Can you \u201chear\u201d it, perhaps? And on a scale of 1 to 10, how intense would you say that feeling is *right now*, as you\u2019re describing it?

Where do you think this belief originated? Can you remember a time in your life \u2013 perhaps a childhood experience \u2013 when someone made you feel this way? It doesn\u2019t have to be a single event; it could be a pattern of criticism or judgment you experienced. Don\u2019t worry about getting all the details right \u2013 just focus on the *feeling* associated with that early experience."
