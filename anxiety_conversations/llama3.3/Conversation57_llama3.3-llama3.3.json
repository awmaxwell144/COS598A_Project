Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

I have over 8 years of experience working with individuals struggling with anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns. I want to assure you that our conversation will be a safe, non-judgmental space for you to express yourself.\n\nWhat's been making you feel anxious or uneasy lately? Is there something specific that's been on your mind, or perhaps a situation that's causing you distress?"

It sounds like your mind is having trouble winding down at night, and maybe even replaying the accident or worrying about something related to it.\n\nCan you tell me more about what specifically goes through your mind when you're lying in bed and unable to sleep? Is it memories of the accident, worries about the future, or something else entirely that's keeping you awake?"

The feeling of being \"on edge\" can be really debilitating.\n\nLet's try to break it down a bit more. When you say your mind starts racing, are there any specific thoughts or worries that come up repeatedly? For example, are you worried about having another accident, or is it more general worries like \"What if something bad happens?\" or \"I'm not safe\"? What is it about being \"on edge\" that's so unsettling for you - is it the fear of losing control, or something else entirely?"

The uncertainty around what's causing them can be really unsettling.\n\nI want to explore this further with you. When you get these headaches, do you notice any other physical sensations in your body, such as nausea, dizziness, or sensitivity to light or sound? And do you think the headaches might be related to the tension and anxiety you've been feeling since the car accident, or could there be something else triggering them?\n\nAlso, when you say the headaches come \"out of nowhere,\" are they usually triggered by a specific situation, like stress or fatigue, or do they seem to happen randomly?"

Sometimes, our bodies can get a bit overwhelmed when we're exploring difficult emotions.\n\nWhile we take this break, I want you to know that you're safe and supported here.
