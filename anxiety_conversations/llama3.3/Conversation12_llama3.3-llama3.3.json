Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

When you say \"everything feels different at home,\" what is it about that difference that's bothering you? Is it the lack of your mom's presence, changes in your routine, or something else?

Before we move on, I just want to gently clarify one thing: when you say \"everything feels kind of... off,\" is it the feeling of emptiness or loss that's bothering you, or is it more about the changes in your daily routine and responsibilities that are causing you distress?

When you feel yourself becoming tense and irritable, are there any specific thoughts or physical sensations that you notice?

Is it like you're feeling mentally foggy, or struggling to concentrate, or maybe feeling overwhelmed by your thoughts and emotions? And are there any specific times of the day or situations where you notice this mental fatigue being worse?

When you say you feel like you \"should\" be able to do more, what does that mean to you? Is there a sense of expectation or pressure coming from yourself or others?

What if you gave yourself permission to feel overwhelmed, to grieve, and to take care of yourself, rather than trying to hold everything together for others?\n\nIt's okay to not have all the answers right now, and it's okay to ask for help. In fact, asking for help can be a sign of strength, not weakness. What do you think would happen if you talked to your dad or siblings about how you're really feeling?

But at the same time, it's exhausting trying to put on a brave face all the time. *pauses, considering* Maybe...maybe talking to them about how I'm really feeling would actually help us all feel closer and more supported. It's just scary to be vulnerable like that.\n\n*looks down, fidgeting with hands again* I guess what you're saying is that it's okay to not have everything together right now, and that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

In fact, it's more than okay - it's necessary. We can't pour from an empty cup, and taking care of yourself is essential to being able to show up for others.\n\n*I lean forward slightly, speaking in a gentle tone* You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed, and it's amazing that you're recognizing the toll it's taking on you.

Can you tell me more about what's holding you back from talking to your family about how you're really feeling? Is it fear of worrying them, fear of being seen as weak, or something else entirely?\n\n*I offer a reassuring nod* Remember, vulnerability is not a weakness - it's a strength.

It's possible that your family may surprise you with their support and empathy.\n\n*I pause for a moment, considering your concerns* That being said, it's also possible that they may not fully understand what you're going through, at least not at first. But by sharing your feelings with them, you can help educate them about what you need from them in terms of support.\n\n*I offer a reassuring nod* Remember, you don't have to face this alone. You can start by talking to one family member who you feel might be more understanding or supportive, and see how that goes. And if you need guidance on how to have this conversation, we can practice it together in our sessions.\n\n*I look at you with kindness and understanding* As for your fear of being seen as less capable, I want you to know that vulnerability is not a sign of weakness. It's a sign of courage, resilience, and strength. By sharing your true feelings with your family, you're showing them that you trust them enough to be honest, and that takes a lot of bravery.\n\n*I smile gently* And what if, instead of trying to \"fix everything,\" your family surprises you by being present for you, listening to you, and offering emotional support? What if they tell you that it's okay to not be okay, and that they're there to support you through this difficult time?\n\n*I pause, letting my words sink in* Would that change anything for you? Would that make it feel safer to open up to them about your feelings?"
