Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why.

Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

    "content": "It takes a lot of courage to share these feelings with me, and I want to acknowledge the depth of your emotional pain. It sounds like you're carrying around a heavy burden of self-doubt and fear of judgment, which can be really suffocating.\n\nFirstly, I want to challenge this idea that you're supposed to be a \"pillar of strength\" or that you're not handling your mom's passing well enough. Grief is a unique and individual experience, and there's no right or wrong way to navigate it. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to show vulnerability and emotion.\n\nRegarding the fear of being a burden to others, I want to offer a different perspective. When you share your emotions with others, you're actually giving them an opportunity to connect with you on a deeper level and to support you in a meaningful way. It's not about taking up too much emotional space; it's about allowing yourself to be seen and heard by others.\n\nAs for the feeling of being a disappointment to others, I want to gently suggest that this might be a narrative that you've internalized over time. Can you think of any specific experiences or interactions that have led you to believe that you're not living up to others' expectations? It's possible that these are unrealistic or unfair expectations, and that you're putting too much pressure on yourself.\n\nNow, regarding self-compassion, I'd like to offer some ideas to get you started. One way to practice self-compassion is to speak to yourself in a kind and gentle tone, just as you would to a close friend. For example, you could say something like, \"I'm doing the best I can right now, and that's enough.\" or \"It's okay to feel overwhelmed; I'm not alone in this.\"\n\nAnother way to practice self-compassion is to engage in activities that bring you comfort and relaxation, such as taking a warm bath, listening to soothing music, or practicing gentle stretches. These small acts of self-care can help you feel more grounded and centered.\n\nFinally, I want to remind you that it's okay to not have all the answers right now, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. We can work together to explore these feelings and develop strategies for building self-compassion and challenging negative self-talk.\n\nHow do these ideas resonate with you? Is there anything in particular that you'd like to explore further or any specific concerns that you have about practicing self-compassion?"
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "*looks up, eyes slightly welled up with tears* Just hearing you say all of this... it feels like a weight is being lifted off my shoulders. I think I've been carrying around these feelings of guilt and shame for so long, and just acknowledging that they're not true is really powerful.\n\nI like the idea of speaking to myself in a kind and gentle tone. It sounds simple, but it's something I've never really done before. I'm used to being my own worst critic, you know? *smiles slightly* But I think I can try to be more compassionate towards myself.\n\nAnd the activities you mentioned, like taking a warm bath or listening to soothing music... those are things that I actually enjoy doing, but I've been feeling too guilty to make time for them lately. It's like I feel like I should be doing something more \"productive\" with my time. But hearing you say that it's okay to take care of myself and prioritize my own well-being... that feels really liberating.\n\nI think what I'd like to explore further is this idea of challenging negative self-talk. I know it's not healthy, but it's just so ingrained in me at this point. Can we work on some strategies for recognizing when I'm engaging in negative self-talk and how to reframe those thoughts in a more positive way? *looks hopeful*"
