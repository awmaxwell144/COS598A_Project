Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

It wasn't just disappointment, though - it was like she felt I was throwing away my potential or something.\n\nWhen people tell me to focus on the good memories and be thankful for the time I had with my mom, it feels like they're not getting it.

It's like you're carrying around this weight of \"what if\" and \"if only,\" and it's hard to shake off.\n\nBut here's the thing: your mom's expectations, while important to her, do not define your worth or potential as a person. You are more than your choices and decisions; you are a unique and valuable individual with strengths, talents, and passions that deserve to be acknowledged and celebrated.\n\nI want to encourage you to start practicing some self-compassion and self-kindness. What would you say to a friend who was struggling with similar feelings of self-doubt and uncertainty? Would you tell them they're not good enough or that they've failed in some way? Or would you offer them words of encouragement, support, and understanding?\n\nRemember, grief is a journey, and it's okay to take your time. You don't have to have all the answers right now, and you don't have to figure everything out on your own. I'm here to support you, and we can work through this together, one step at a time.\n\nBefore we wrap up for today, is there anything that feels like a small step forward or a glimmer of hope for you?

I would never tell a friend that they're not good enough or that they've failed in some way. I would offer them support and encouragement, and remind them that they're doing the best they can. So, maybe it's time for me to start practicing that same kindness towards myself.\n\nAs for something that feels like a small step forward... (pauses, thinking) I think it might be the idea of honoring my mom's memory in some way. Maybe it could be as simple as looking through old photos or cooking one of her favorite recipes. It's not much, but it feels like a start.\n\n(smiles slightly) And I guess just being able to talk about all this without feeling completely overwhelmed is a small victory in itself. So, thank you for listening and for being here to support me. It means a lot to me.\n\n(looks down, fidgets slightly) Sorry again for getting so emotional.
