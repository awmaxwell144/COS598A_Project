    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

The feeling of restlessness you're describing doesn't sound weird at all; it's actually a common physical symptom of anxiety and grief. It's as if your body is trying to release pent-up emotions.\n\nCan you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you start pacing? Is it worries about the future, memories of your mom, or something else entirely?"

That can be really overwhelming.\n\nLet's try to break it down a bit. When you say \"thoughts just keep popping up,\" what kind of thoughts are they? Are they worries about everyday things, like work or bills, or are they more emotional thoughts, like memories or feelings about your mom's passing?"

We can absolutely take a step back and focus on something else for now.\n\nLet's talk about how you've been taking care of yourself physically since your mom passed away.

That can be really frustrating and exhausting.\n\nCan you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you're lying awake at night? Are you thinking about your mom, or are there other worries or thoughts that are keeping you up?

Those knots in your stomach and the feeling of a weight on your chest can be really unsettling.\n\nI want to explore this further. When you say \"it's just a lot of little things,\" what do you mean by that? Are there specific thoughts or worries that are contributing to these physical sensations, or is it more of a general feeling of anxiety or unease?\n\nLet's try to break it down together. What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think about what might be causing these physical symptoms? Is it related to your mom's passing, or is there something else going on in your life that might be contributing to this tension?"

It sounds like you're feeling a bit snowed under by the demands of daily life, and on top of that, you're also dealing with the emotional weight of your mom's passing. It's completely understandable that even small tasks might feel overwhelming right now.\n\nI want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, so thank you for being honest about how you're feeling. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help.\n\nLet's try to explore this sense of overwhelm a bit further. When you say \"everything is piling up,\" what do you think would happen if you didn't get everything done? What's the worst-case scenario that's playing out in your mind? Is it something specific, like fear of failure or disappointment, or is it more of a general feeling of being overwhelmed?"

    "content": "It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility and self-expectation, and it's weighing you down. This feeling of being \"behind\" and needing to stay on top of things is creating a sense of anxiety and pressure that's hard to shake.\n\nI want to gently explore this further. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to not be in control of everything? If you gave yourself permission to not have all the answers, to not meet all the expectations, and to just be okay with being imperfect? Would that feel like a relief, or would it trigger some other emotions?\n\nAlso, when you say \"going through the motions\" and trying to keep up appearances, what do you think people would see if they looked beyond the surface? Is there a fear of being judged, rejected, or seen as weak if you're not able to hold it together?"

What if people see me as weak or incapable?\n\n*looks down, fidgeting slightly* And yeah, I think there is a fear of being judged or rejected. I've always tried to present this perfect image, you know? Like, I'm fine, I can handle it all. But if people saw the real me, the me who's struggling and unsure... I don't know, it feels like they would lose respect for me or something.\n\n*trails off, looking uncertain* Does that make sense?"

    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "It makes perfect sense. It takes a lot of courage to admit to these fears and insecurities, so thank you for being honest with me. It's clear that you've been carrying this weight of expectation and control for a long time, and it's exhausting.\n\nI want to challenge some of these assumptions gently. What if, instead of losing respect, people actually gained more respect for you because you're willing to be vulnerable and authentic? What if they saw your struggles and imperfections as a sign of strength, rather than weakness?\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention presenting a \"perfect image.\" Who do you think is expecting this perfection from you? Is it others, or is it yourself? Are there any specific people or relationships in your life where you feel like you need to maintain this image?\n\nRemember, we're not trying to change everything at once. We're just exploring these thoughts and feelings together. You're safe, and you're allowed to be imperfect."
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "*pauses, looking thoughtful* I think it's a bit of both, to be honest. I've always been someone who tries to please others and make them happy, so I feel like there's an expectation from others to be perfect. But at the same time, I also put a lot of pressure on myself to be perfect. It's like, I want to be able to handle everything and not need anyone else's help.\n\n*looks down, fidgeting slightly* And yeah, there are definitely specific people in my life where I feel like I need to maintain this image. Like, my mom was always really proud of me and expected a lot from me, and now that she's gone... I don't know, it feels like I'm still trying to live up to her expectations, even though she's not here anymore.\n\n*trails off, looking uncertain* Does that make sense? Am I just trying to hold on to something that's not even real anymore?"
  },
  {
    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "It makes perfect sense. It's as if you're carrying a legacy of expectation and perfectionism that was instilled in you by your mom, and now that she's gone, you're struggling to let go of it. It's like you're trying to keep her memory alive by living up to the expectations she had for you, even though it's no longer possible.\n\nThis is a really common phenomenon, by the way. When we lose someone important to us, we often try to hold on to the relationships and dynamics we had with them, even if they're no longer physically present. It's a way of keeping them close, but it can also be a source of pain and struggle.\n\nI want to ask you something gently: what do you think your mom would say to you if she were here right now? Would she want you to be struggling to live up to these expectations, or would she want you to be kinder to yourself and allow yourself to be imperfect?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of \"not needing anyone else's help.\" What's behind that desire for self-sufficiency? Is it a fear of being vulnerable, or is it something else entirely?"
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "*pauses, looking thoughtful* If my mom were here right now... I think she would tell me to take care of myself and not be so hard on myself. She would want me to be happy and fulfilled, not just trying to live up to some ideal or expectation. She was always proud of me, but she also wanted me to be kind to myself and prioritize my own well-being.\n\n*looks down, fidgeting slightly* As for the self-sufficiency thing... I think it's a mix of fear and habit. I've always been someone who tries to handle things on my own, partly because I don't want to burden others with my problems, and partly because I'm afraid of being vulnerable or dependent on someone else. It's like, if I can just take care of everything myself, then I'll be safe and in control.\n\n*pauses again, looking up* But at the same time, I think that's also what's been holding me back. I've been so focused on trying to do everything perfectly and on my own that I haven't allowed myself to ask for help or support when I need it. And now, with my mom gone... it feels like I'm really struggling to cope with all of this on my own.\n\n*looks at you uncertainly* Does that make sense? Am I just trying to hold on to something that's not serving me anymore?"
