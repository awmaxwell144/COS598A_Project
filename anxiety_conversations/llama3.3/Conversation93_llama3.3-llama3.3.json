    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, irritability, excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and somatic complaints (like stomach discomfort or headaches). This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

The fact that your mind is racing at night suggests that you might be experiencing some anxiety or worry related to the accident.\n\nCan you tell me more about what specifically goes through your mind when you're lying in bed and unable to sleep? Is it thoughts about the accident itself, worries about the future, or something else entirely?"

The feeling of jitteriness in your legs is quite common when we're feeling overwhelmed or on edge.\n\nIt takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share these feelings, so thank you for being open with me. Can you help me understand what might be driving this restlessness?

Sometimes, our bodies can manifest emotional distress in physical ways, like stomach issues.\n\nI want to explore this further with you. When you say your stomach feels \"tight\" and has \"knots,\" what does that feel like, exactly? Is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or more of a sensation of discomfort?

You mentioned that the discomfort worsens when you're stressed or worried. What do you think is the underlying cause of that stress or worry? Is it related to the car accident, or are there other things on your mind that might be contributing to these feelings?"

It's understandable that you're struggling to cope with the aftermath of the accident, and it's not uncommon for people to experience changes in their mood and behavior after a traumatic event.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention feeling \"fragile\" now. Can you tell me more about what you mean by that? Is it like you feel like you're walking on eggshells, waiting for something else to go wrong?

It's like I've been running on adrenaline all day, and then suddenly I just crash and feel completely exhausted. And sometimes, if I'm doing something that requires a lot of mental effort, like work or studying, I'll feel more tired afterwards. But even doing simple things, like watching TV or browsing my phone, can feel draining sometimes.\n\nI don't know, it's just like I've lost my energy and my motivation, and I don't know how to get them back. It's really frustrating, because I feel like I should be able to do more and accomplish more, but right now it feels like just getting through the day is a struggle."
