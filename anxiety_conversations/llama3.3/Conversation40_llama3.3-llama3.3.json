Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

But at the same time, I want to keep some of the old things that remind me of her, like the old wooden trellis she used to train her roses on. *Pauses, lost in thought* Just thinking about it is making me feel a little better, I think.\n\nIt's funny, I never really helped my mom with the garden when she was alive. I would just kind of... watch her do it, and admire how beautiful it looked.

The fact that you're considering adding new elements to the garden while still preserving some of the old, special things, shows that you're trying to find a balance between honoring her legacy and making it your own.\n\nIt's beautiful that you have fond memories of watching your mom tend to the garden, and now, by taking care of it yourself, you're creating a sense of continuity and connection with her. It's almost as if you're having a conversation with her through the garden, and that can be a powerful way to process your grief.\n\nThe sunflower, in particular, seems to hold special significance for you. Getting it to bloom again could be a meaningful way to celebrate your mom's life and memory. *Pauses* Can you tell me more about what you think will happen when the sunflower blooms? What do you hope to feel or experience in that moment?\n\nAlso, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel a mix of emotions as you navigate this process.

I'm wondering if you're ready to start thinking about taking some small steps towards nurturing the garden and honoring her legacy. Perhaps we could brainstorm some specific actions you could take, like planting new seeds or tending to the existing flowers?\n\nRemember, it's okay to start small and take things one step at a time. The goal is to find ways to feel more connected to your mom and to yourself, not to add more stress or pressure to your life. *Offers a gentle, encouraging smile* What do you think? Is there something that feels like a manageable first step for you?"
