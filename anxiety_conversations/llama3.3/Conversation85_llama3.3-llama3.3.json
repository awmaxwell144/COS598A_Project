Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

    "content": "It can be really frustrating when our minds start racing and we can't seem to quiet them down. The physical symptoms, like the stomach issues, can be especially uncomfortable.\n\nLet's try to break it down a bit. When you say your mind starts racing, what do you mean by that? Is it more like worrying about specific things, like \"what if\" scenarios, or is it more of a general feeling of anxiety or unease? And when you feel \"all wound up,\" do you notice any other physical sensations, such as a rapid heartbeat, sweating, or tension in your muscles?"

The image of carrying around a heavy weight is a powerful one - it's like your body is literally shouldering the burden of your emotions.\n\nI want to explore this feeling of tension a bit further. When you say you feel tense \"all the time,\" do you mean that it's constant, or are there certain situations or triggers that make it worse? For example, do you notice that your tension increases when you're thinking about your mom, or when you're in certain environments or around certain people?"

This can be really challenging, especially when it feels like your emotions are simmering just below the surface, waiting to boil over.\n\nI'm curious - what do you think is driving this feeling of frustration and irritability? Is it possible that you're avoiding certain thoughts or feelings related to your mom's passing, and that's contributing to this sense of tension and reactivity? Or might there be other factors at play, such as feelings of guilt, regret, or anxiety about the future? What is it about these everyday tasks that's triggering this frustration - is it the reminder of your mom, the feeling of being alone, or something else entirely?"

Are they memories of your mom, worries about the future, or something else entirely? Sometimes, our brains can get stuck on certain thoughts or emotions, and it can be helpful to acknowledge and understand what's driving that.\n\nAlso, have you noticed any patterns or triggers that make it harder for you to focus?

It's not always easy to recognize or express our own needs, especially when we're used to putting others first or pushing through challenges.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you mean by \"running on empty\"? Is it like you've lost your sense of purpose or motivation, or is it more that you're feeling overwhelmed by your emotions and don't know how to cope?

That it's okay to take things one step at a time and focus on small, manageable tasks.\n\n*looks down, fidgeting with hands* I'd like to work on trying to be kinder to myself, I guess.
