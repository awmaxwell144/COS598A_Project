Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

You mentioned it's been bothering you lately - can you tell me more about what's been going on? Are you experiencing any specific symptoms like nausea, cramps, or discomfort?

You mentioned your mom's passing earlier, and now you're hinting at a possible connection between that and your physical symptoms. What is it about the current situation that you think might be contributing to your stomach problems?

It's hard to separate everything out and figure out what's causing what. (pausing, taking a deep breath) Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions, you know?

That can be a really tough place to be, especially when you're trying to navigate so many practical responsibilities on top of your grief.\n\n(I lean forward slightly, my voice taking on a softer tone) Can you tell me more about what you mean by \"going through the motions\"? What does that feel like for you? Is it like you're observing yourself from outside, watching yourself do things without really being present in the moment? And when you say \"other times...\", what happens then? Do you feel a surge of emotions, or is it something else entirely?\n\n(I pause, studying your expression) You mentioned earlier that you've been having trouble sleeping and experiencing stomach issues. Have you noticed if these physical symptoms tend to worsen or improve when you're feeling overwhelmed or disconnected from your emotions? For example, do you find that your stomach troubles get worse when you're dealing with practical tasks like sorting out your mom's estate, or is it more related to the emotional aspects of your grief?\n\n(I make a gentle gesture with my hand) Remember, we're not trying to rush through this or figure everything out all at once. We're just taking small steps, exploring your feelings and experiences one by one. You're doing great, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.

(pausing, looking down) I'll be doing something, like cooking dinner or something, and suddenly I'll just feel this wave of sadness or frustration or whatever, and it's like it comes out of nowhere. It's really disorienting.\n\n(looking up, eyes slightly wide) And yeah, I think my stomach issues might be worse when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Like, if I'm dealing with a lot of paperwork or talking to lawyers, my stomach will start to feel all knotted up and uncomfortable. But it's not just that... sometimes I'll be sitting at home, just doing nothing, and I'll still feel this tension in my body, like I'm waiting for something to happen or something.

It's as if your body is \"on high alert,\" waiting for something to happen or anticipating some kind of threat. This can be a common experience for people who are grieving or feeling overwhelmed.\n\n(I pause, studying your expression) I want to explore this idea of \"waiting for something to happen\" further.

(pausing, looking down) And sometimes I'll be out in public and I'll see someone who reminds me of her, or I'll hear a song that she used to like, and it's just... (trailing off, taking a deep breath)\n\n(looking up, eyes slightly wide) It's like my whole body tenses up, and I just want to get away from the situation. I don't know, maybe I'm just trying to avoid feeling sad or overwhelmed or something. But it's hard to explain, because it's not just about avoiding those feelings... it's like I'm trying to avoid remembering her, too. (pausing, frowning) Does that make any sense?"

But on the other hand, you're also trying to avoid remembering her, which can be a really painful and confusing experience.\n\n(I lean forward slightly, my voice gentle) It's as if you're caught between two opposing forces: the desire to hold on to memories of your mom, and the need to protect yourself from the pain of those memories. This can be a really difficult and delicate balance to navigate.\n\n(I pause, studying your expression) I want to explore this idea of avoiding memories of your mom further. What do you think is driving this desire to avoid remembering her? Is it fear of feeling overwhelmed or sad, or is it something else entirely? Are you worried that if you remember her too much, you'll become stuck in your grief and unable to move forward?\n\n(I make a gentle gesture with my hand) Remember, we're not trying to force you to confront anything that feels too difficult.

It's frustrating, because I know I need to get things done, but my brain just feels so... foggy.\n\n(looking down, fidgeting with hands) And it's not just work or chores. Even things I used to enjoy, like reading or watching movies, just feel empty and pointless now. Like, what's the point of doing anything when...

This can be a really painful and confusing experience, but it's not uncommon.\n\n(I pause, studying your expression) I want to reassure you that you're not stuck, and you're not alone in feeling this way. Grief is a process, and it takes time to work through. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.\n\n(I make a gentle gesture with my hand) Remember, grief is not just about the person who died; it's also about the relationship you had with them, and the sense of identity and purpose that came with that relationship. It's normal for your sense of self and your place in the world to feel shaken or uncertain after a loss like this.\n\n(I lean back slightly, my eyes never leaving yours) I want to ask you something: what do you think your mom would want for you right now? Would she want you to be happy, to find meaning and purpose again, or would she want you to take time to grieve and heal?\n\n(I pause, allowing you to reflect on this question) Also, I want to explore the social impact of your grief.

For example, are you feeling more isolated or withdrawn, or are you struggling to connect with others who may not understand what you're going through?\n\n(I lean forward slightly, my voice gentle) And finally, I want to ask about your self-care and support system. Are there any activities, people, or resources that have been helping you cope with your grief and find comfort during this difficult time?"

    "content": "(pauses, looking down, and taking a deep breath) Honestly, I think my mom would want me to be happy and find meaning again. She always wanted the best for me, and she'd want me to move forward, even if it's hard. But at the same time, I feel like she'd also understand if I need to take time to grieve and heal. She was always so supportive and caring, and I know she'd want me to take care of myself.\n\n(looks up, eyes slightly welling up with tears) As for my relationships with friends and family, it's been... complicated. Some people have been really understanding and supportive, but others seem to expect me to just \"get over it\" or \"move on\" already. It's hard when they don't get it, you know? They don't understand what I'm going through, and it feels like they're not really listening.\n\n(shrugs slightly) As for self-care and support, I've been trying to do some things that used to bring me comfort, like taking walks or listening to music. But to be honest, it's hard to find the motivation to do even those things when everything feels so empty and pointless. I've also been talking to a few close friends who have lost loved ones, and they've been really helpful in understanding what I'm going through.\n\n(pauses, looking down again) I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's hard to find comfort or support when everything feels so overwhelming and uncertain. But at the same time, I know I need to keep trying, for my mom's sake as much as mine.

In fact, that's a beautiful way to keep her memory alive - by living the life she would have wanted you to live.\n\n(I lean forward slightly, my voice gentle) It's not about forgetting her or moving on from your grief; it's about finding ways to integrate your memories of her into your daily life, and using those memories as a source of strength and inspiration. You can honor her memory by doing things that remind you of her, like cooking her favorite recipes, visiting places she loved, or engaging in activities that she enjoyed.\n\n(I pause, studying your expression) It's also important to remember that grief is not a linear process; it's okay to take two steps forward and one step back. You may have good days and bad days, and that's perfectly normal. The key is to be patient with yourself, and to allow yourself to feel whatever emotions arise.\n\n(I make a gentle gesture with my hand) As for being stuck in limbo, I don't think that's true. You're not stuck; you're just navigating a really difficult and uncertain time. And it's okay to take your time figuring things out. Your mom would want you to be kind to yourself, and to prioritize your own healing and well-being.\n\n(I smile softly) I want to leave you with a thought: what if honoring your mom's memory isn't about doing something big or grand; what if it's just about living your life with intention, purpose, and love? What if it's about finding ways to make her proud, not by achieving some specific goal, but by being the best version of yourself?\n\n(I pause, allowing you to reflect on this question) Remember, you're not alone in this journey. I'm here to support you, and there are many resources available to help you navigate your grief. Take things one step at a time, be kind to yourself, and trust that you'll find a way to honor your mom's memory while moving forward with your life.\n\n(I lean back slightly, my eyes never leaving yours) And finally, I want to ask: what's one small thing you could do today to start moving forward, even if it feels like just a tiny step? Could you take a walk outside, or write in a journal, or simply take a few deep breaths and focus on the present moment? Sometimes, it's the smallest actions that can help us build momentum and find our way again."

Like, I'm keeping a part of her alive by cooking something that she loved. (I smile slightly) It's not much, but it feels like a start.\n\n(I look at you, seeking reassurance) Do you think that's a good idea? Or am I just trying to distract myself from my grief?

That dish will always be tied to memories of her, and recreating it can be a way to feel closer to her again. It's a sensory experience that can transport you back to happy times, and that can be incredibly comforting.\n\n(I pause, looking at you with kindness) As for whether you're doing enough to remember her, I want to reassure you that there's no right or wrong way to grieve. Everyone's journey is unique, and what matters most is that you're taking steps to honor your mom's memory in a way that feels authentic to you.\n\n(I smile softly) You're not just cooking a meal; you're creating a ritual that can help you process your emotions and feel more connected to your mom. And that's something to be proud of. It takes courage to face your grief head-on, and it sounds like you're doing just that.\n\n(I lean back slightly, my eyes never leaving yours) Remember, grief is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and to find ways to honor your mom's memory that feel meaningful to you.

So, in a way, making her pasta sauce with meatballs feels like I'm still showing her love, even though she's not here anymore.\n\n(I take a deep breath, feeling a sense of peace wash over me) Yeah, I think she'd be proud of me for finding ways to remember her and honor her memory. She always wanted me to be happy, and if cooking her recipes makes me feel closer to her, then that's what I'll keep doing.\n\n(I smile slightly, feeling a sense of connection to my mom) You know, it's funny... when I'm cooking, I feel like she's still with me, guiding my hands and telling me what to do. It's like she's still teaching me, even though she's not here physically. (I look up, my eyes shining with tears) And that feels really special.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath) Sorry, I think I might be getting a little emotional again. (I laugh slightly, feeling a sense of embarrassment) It's just... it's hard to believe she's really gone, you know? But at the same time, I feel like she's still with me, in my heart and in my memories. And that gives me the strength to keep going, even when things feel tough.\n\n(I look up, smiling softly) Thanks for listening, and for helping me see that I'm not alone in this. It means a lot to me."
