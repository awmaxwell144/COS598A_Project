    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

It sounds like you're feeling a bit isolated, but at the same time, you're not sure how to reach out or connect with others right now.\n\nCan you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you think about social interactions?

You don't have to have everything figured out, and it's okay to take time for yourself to work through these feelings. It's actually really brave of you to acknowledge that you're not feeling like yourself, and that takes a lot of self-awareness.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you mean by \"not being yourself\"?

Am I right? Are you finding that your mind keeps drifting back to those topics, even when you're trying to focus on something else?\n\nLet's try to explore this a bit further. When you do get distracted, what are some of the things that your mind tends to wander to? Is it worst-case scenarios, self-criticism, or perhaps worries about the future? And what happens when you try to refocus your attention on the task at hand? Do you find that you can eventually calm your mind and concentrate, or does the distraction persist?"

It's as if your mind is constantly shifting between different thoughts and tasks, making it difficult for you to settle on any one thing.\n\nI want to reassure you that this is a common experience, especially when we're feeling stressed or overwhelmed. It's not necessarily about being able to \"control\" your thoughts, but rather about learning to work with your mind in a way that helps you stay focused and productive.\n\nLet's try to break it down a bit further. When you say that your brain feels \"too tired\" to concentrate, what do you think is contributing to that feeling of mental exhaustion? Is it the constant worrying or ruminating on things, or perhaps the lack of sleep or physical activity? And when you're able to refocus and get back on track, what helps you to do so? Is it taking a break, engaging in a relaxing activity, or something else entirely?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of \"should be able to control my own thoughts\" a bit further. What do you think would happen if you couldn't control your thoughts all the time? Would that mean that you're somehow failing or inadequate? Or is there another fear or concern underlying that thought?"

This can be really exhausting and make it hard to relax or feel calm.\n\nLet's explore this connection to what happened at work a few weeks ago. You mentioned earlier that the project didn't go as planned, and you've been feeling anxious and irritable since then. Could it be that your mind is still trying to process and make sense of what happened? Maybe there are some unresolved emotions or thoughts related to that experience that are contributing to this feeling of being \"on edge\"?\n\nI want to ask you a question: What do you think would happen if you were able to fully resolve or come to terms with what happened at work? Would that alleviate some of this anxiety and hypervigilance, or is there something else driving these feelings?\n\nAlso, I'm curious - when you're thinking about all the things that could go wrong, are they specific worries related to work, or are they more general concerns about life in general? Are there any particular themes or patterns that emerge in your worried thoughts?"
  },

    "role": "patient",
    "content": "*looks down, fidgeting slightly* I think it's a mix of both, to be honest. Sometimes I worry about specific things related to work, like whether I'll be able to meet my deadlines or if my boss will be disappointed in me. But other times, my worries feel more general and vague, like I'm just waiting for something bad to happen without knowing what it is.\n\n*pauses, taking a deep breath* As for resolving what happened at work... I'm not sure. I think it would definitely help to talk through some of the emotions and thoughts that are still stuck in my head. Maybe if I could understand what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again, I'd feel more in control and less anxious.\n\n*looks up, slightly hesitant* But at the same time, I'm not sure if that's the only thing driving these feelings. Sometimes I feel like there's just this underlying sense of unease or uncertainty that's always there, even when things are going well. It's hard to explain, but it's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? *trails off, looking uncertain*"
