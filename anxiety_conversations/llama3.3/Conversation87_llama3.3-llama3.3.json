Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms.

When you say \"everything is piling up on me,\" what's the worst part about that feeling? Is it the fear of not being able to handle it all, the worry about making mistakes, or something else?

When you think about making mistakes with your mom's estate or forgetting something important, what's the worst-case scenario that comes to mind? What are you most afraid of happening?\n\nAlso, I noticed you mentioned feeling irritable and overwhelmed by small things, like loud noises. Are there any other situations or activities that you've been avoiding lately because they feel too overwhelming or stressful?

I've been turning down invitations from friends and family because the thought of putting on a brave face and pretending like everything is okay just feels too exhausting. *looks up, slightly sheepish* I know it's not fair to them, but I just don't feel like I can handle all the questions and sympathy right now."

Avoiding social events or certain tasks doesn't mean you're being unfair to others; it means you're taking care of yourself and prioritizing your own emotional well-being.\n\nLet's explore this idea of \"putting on a brave face\" further. What do you think would happen if you didn't put on that brave face, and instead allowed yourself to show your true emotions and vulnerability? What are you afraid others might think or feel if you're not pretending to be okay?\n\nAlso, I'm curious - what do you think is the underlying fear or concern that's driving your avoidance of sorting out your mom's estate?

It would mean that she's really gone, and I'd have to confront all the memories and emotions that come with that. *looks up, eyes welling up slightly* It's like, if I don't do it, I can still pretend that she might come back or something. But if I start going through her things, it would be like I'm accepting that she's really gone, and that's just... hard to face. *pauses, struggling to hold back tears* Sometimes my stomach gets all knotted up just thinking about it..."

In fact, allowing yourself to feel and express those emotions can be a powerful step towards healing. *offers a supportive nod*\n\nIt sounds like you're struggling with a sense of denial or avoidance when it comes to sorting out your mom's estate. It's like you're caught between the desire to hold on to the hope that she might come back, and the painful reality that she's really gone.\n\nI'm here to support you in exploring these emotions further.

What are some of the specific memories or emotions that you're afraid of confronting?\n\nAlso, I want to acknowledge the physical sensations you mentioned earlier - the knotted stomach, the tension in your shoulders.

It would be like she's still there, but at the same time, it would be a harsh reminder that she's really gone. *pauses, taking a deep breath*\n\nI'm also afraid of finding things that will make me feel guilty or regretful. Like, what if I find a letter or a note that she wrote to me, and it says something that makes me wish I had done things differently? *looks up, eyes welling up again* Or what if I find something that makes me realize I didn't appreciate her enough when she was here?\n\nAs for physical symptoms... *hesitates* Yeah, my appetite has been pretty off lately. Some days I'm just not hungry at all, and other days I'll eat a whole bunch of comfort food just to try and feel better. And my energy levels have been really low too. I'll be doing something simple like laundry or dishes, and suddenly I'll just feel exhausted and need to take a break. *sighs* It's like my body is just drained all the time."

It's not easy to confront the possibility of feeling guilty or regretful, especially when it comes to our relationships with loved ones.\n\nIt might be helpful to reframe your thinking around going through your mom's belongings. Instead of seeing it as a daunting task that will overwhelm you with emotions, perhaps we can approach it as an opportunity for closure, reflection, and celebration of her life. We could work together to create a safe and supportive environment for you to explore these memories and emotions.\n\nRegarding your physical symptoms, it's clear that your body is responding to the emotional stress you're under. The changes in appetite, energy levels, and sleep patterns are all common responses to grief and anxiety. I'd like to explore some coping strategies with you that might help alleviate some of these physical symptoms. For example, we could discuss relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to help manage your stress and anxiety.\n\nBefore we move forward, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling right now. Are there any specific emotions or concerns that are feeling particularly overwhelming for you at the moment? Is there anything that's feeling like it's too much to handle, or anything that you're worried about facing in the coming days or weeks?\n\nAlso, I'd like to ask, what do you think would be the first step for you in starting to go through your mom's belongings?

While it's possible that they're related to stress and anxiety, I want to encourage you to take care of your physical health as well.
