Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms.

Is it specifically related to your mom's passing, or are there other factors at play as well?

It's okay to take your time and not rush into situations that feel too difficult right now. Avoiding certain places or people might be a coping mechanism for you, but I also want to gently explore how this might be affecting your daily life and relationships.\n\nFor example, are there any specific social or occupational activities that you've been avoiding because they remind you of your mom or make you feel anxious? Are there any relationships that have been affected by your avoidance behaviors, such as friends or family members who are trying to support you?\n\nIt's also important to recognize that avoiding these things might provide temporary relief, but it could also be preventing you from processing your emotions and moving forward. I'm not saying you need to confront everything all at once, but maybe we can start small. Would you be willing to explore some of these avoided places or activities with me, in a safe and controlled way? Perhaps we can start by talking about what it would be like to go back to your mom's house, or to see someone who reminds you of her.\n\nRemember, I'm here to support you, not to push you into anything that feels too scary.

Are there any specific activities or rituals that have helped you feel even slightly better, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature?\n\nAlso, I want to gently explore the idea that this fatigue might be linked to some underlying emotions or thoughts. Sometimes, our bodies can manifest emotional pain as physical exhaustion. Can you think of any emotions or thoughts that might be contributing to your feeling of fatigue?

I've tried listening to music or reading, but it's hard to focus. *pauses, looking up* I guess what has helped a little bit is talking to friends and family about my mom. It feels good to share stories and memories with people who care about me.\n\nRegarding emotions or thoughts that might be contributing to my fatigue... *hesitates* I think I do feel some guilt and regret. There are things I wish I had said or done differently, and it's hard not to get caught up in those thoughts. And sometimes I worry about the future, like how I'll navigate life without my mom.

Sharing stories and memories can be a powerful way to process your emotions and feel connected to others. Have you considered writing down some of these stories or memories? Sometimes putting your thoughts and feelings into words can be a therapeutic way to process your grief.\n\nRegarding your worries about the future, I want to reassure you that it's normal to feel uncertain and scared.
