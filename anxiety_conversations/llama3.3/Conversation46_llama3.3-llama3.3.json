    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, irritability, excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and somatic complaints (like stomach discomfort or headaches). This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

I have over 8 years of experience working with individuals to address anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns. I want you to know that this is a safe and non-judgmental space for you to share your thoughts and feelings.\n\nWhat's been making you feel anxious or uneasy lately? Is there something specific that's been on your mind, or perhaps a situation that's causing you distress?"

It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and like your mind is racing.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you mean by \"everything\" when you say your brain is thinking about everything at once? Is it worries about the future, memories of your mom, or something else entirely? What are some of the specific thoughts that keep popping into your head and won't seem to quiet down?"

I keep thinking about all the things I need to do now that she's gone, like taking care of her house and dealing with her belongings.

It's like you're trying to navigate a new reality without her, and it's overwhelming.\n\nWhen you say you feel \"restless\" during simple tasks like making dinner, do you notice any physical sensations in your body? For example, is your heart racing, are your muscles tense, or are you experiencing any other bodily feelings that might be contributing to this sense of restlessness?"

It sounds like you're experiencing some physical tension that's likely related to the emotional stress and anxiety you've been feeling since your mom's passing. The image of carrying a weight on your shoulders is a powerful metaphor for the emotional burden you're shouldering.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you think that weight represents?

The \"knot in the gut\" sensation can be a really uncomfortable and unsettling feeling.\n\nIt takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share these kinds of physical symptoms, so thank you for being honest with me. It sounds like your body might be responding to some underlying fears or worries that are still lurking beneath the surface.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you think might be causing that knot in your stomach?

That says a lot about your empathy and kindness towards others.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you think is driving that frustration with yourself? Is it the feeling like you're not measuring up, or that you're letting people down? What do you think you need to be able to forgive yourself and move forward, rather than getting stuck in that cycle of self-criticism?"

Maybe making some of those recipes again would bring back happy memories and make me feel closer to her.\n\n*pauses, collecting thoughts*\n\nI also think it would be nice to visit some of the places we used to go together, like the park where we'd take walks or the beach where we'd spend summer vacations. Just being in those familiar environments might help me feel more connected to her and to the happy times we shared.\n\n*looks up, eyes shining with tears*\n\nAnd I think I'd like to start a memory book or scrapbook, where I can collect mementos and memories of our time together. That way, I can look back on those happy moments whenever I'm feeling sad or overwhelmed.\n\n*takes a deep breath, smiling slightly*\n\nJust talking about this is helping me feel a little better, I think.
