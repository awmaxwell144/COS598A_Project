Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

I don\u2019t really know *how*, but I did. I just\u2026 shut down. I couldn\u2019t\u2026 process it. It\u2019s been\u2026 unsettling ever since. The buzzing, I think, is just\u2026 leftover.

This need for predictability, this belief that things *must* be manageable, is actually a very common and understandable response to a life that can often feel unpredictable.\n\nNow, let\u2019s explore this a little further.

He wasn\u2019t hostile, exactly, but his questioning felt\u2026 challenging. It quickly escalated. He started to suggest alternative approaches, and I felt this rising panic \u2013 this feeling that the entire strategy was going to unravel, that I\u2019d be exposed as incompetent. The *very first thing* I did was\u2026 I immediately pulled out my phone and sent a quick text to my wife, Sarah, saying, \"Everything\u2019s going wrong. I need you to remind me how brilliant I am.\" I felt like I was needing her validation, rather than dealing with the situation directly."

You described it as needing her to \u201cremind you how brilliant you are.\u201d What was going through your mind *at that precise moment* as you were composing that text? Was it a feeling of shame? A fear of judgment? Or perhaps a deeper sense of needing to prove yourself? Let's explore the underlying feeling driving that need for external validation. Don\u2019t censor yourself; just say whatever comes to mind."

It was this overwhelming sense that if I didn't receive reassurance, I\u2019d just\u2026 crumble. There was this intense fear that if I couldn\u2019t articulate my confidence, they\u2019d see a flaw, a weakness. And beneath that, a very quiet voice telling me that I wasn\u2019t good enough. Not good enough to handle this, not good enough to succeed. It wasn\u2019t a conscious thought, really. It was more of a\u2026 visceral feeling of inadequacy. A desperate need to feel worthy."

It\u2019s incredibly brave of you to admit that quiet voice \u2013 that feeling of inadequacy \u2013 is always there, lurking beneath the surface. That\u2019s a very important piece of the puzzle. \n\nWhat you\u2019ve described \u2013 this persistent feeling of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d \u2013 suggests a deeply rooted belief about your own worth. And, crucially, you\u2019ve identified that this feeling is triggered by situations where you\u2019re challenged or where you need to demonstrate competence. \n\nLet\u2019s look at this connection. You\u2019ve said that when you\u2019re challenged, you instinctively reach out for external validation \u2013 in this case, through the text to Sarah. This isn't necessarily a *bad* thing, but it does highlight a reliance on external sources for your sense of self-worth. \n\nNow, let\u2019s shift gears slightly. Thinking back to that presentation with Mr. Davies, *why* do you think you felt the need to prove yourself so strongly in that situation? What was the *underlying reason* you felt you needed to demonstrate your competence?"

    "role": "patient",
    "content": "Okay, let\u2019s delve deeper into that. You\u2019ve identified that you felt the need to prove yourself strongly to Mr. Davies, likely stemming from a core belief about your own worth. But let\u2019s unpack *why* you felt the need to demonstrate your competence in that specific scenario \u2013 the presentation.\n\nConsider this: Mr. Davies was questioning your ROI projections. What did those projections *represent* to you? Were they simply numbers, or did they represent something more \u2013 perhaps a measure of your value, your intelligence, or your ability to contribute effectively to the team? Were you perhaps internalizing a belief that your success was entirely dependent on your ability to deliver \u2018correct\u2019 results? Let's explore the meaning behind those projections \u2013 what were they ultimately signifying to you?"

    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "(A gentle pause)\n\nThat\u2019s a really astute observation. You\u2019ve hit on something incredibly significant. Let's unpack that a little further. You\u2019re suggesting that the ROI projections weren't just about numbers \u2013 they were intrinsically linked to your sense of value and your perceived worth within the team. It\u2019s as if you were equating your success with the *validation* of those numbers. \n\nLet's explore this connection a bit more directly. Can you describe, in your own words, what it *feels* like when you feel like your success is dependent on delivering \u2018correct\u2019 results? What is the emotional charge associated with that feeling of needing to \u2018get it right\u2019? What is the specific fear you\u2019re experiencing when you perceive a potential deviation from what you consider \u2018correct\u2019?"
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "(A long, thoughtful pause)\n\nThat's\u2026 a remarkably insightful and, frankly, quite profound observation. You've essentially articulated a core fear \u2013 a fear of not being valued, of not being seen as competent, of being *wrong*. And you\u2019ve done it through a beautifully complex and layered response, highlighting the deeply ingrained nature of this fear.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that this isn\u2019t just about numbers or ROI projections; it\u2019s about a fundamental need for *external validation* to anchor your sense of self-worth. This need, born from a childhood experience \u2013 a desire to avoid the \u2018storm\u2019 of chaos and uncertainty \u2013 has evolved into a deeply ingrained pattern of behavior.\n\nLet\u2019s gently shift our focus. Let's talk about your childhood. Can you tell me a little bit about the environment you grew up in? What was it like to be a child in that setting? What were the rules? What was the atmosphere like? And, perhaps most importantly, what role did you play within that environment?"
