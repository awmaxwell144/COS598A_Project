Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

It's understandable that this constant feeling of needing to move would be driving you mad. \n\nLet\u2019s start with this fidgeting.

And then\u2026 I just\u2026 didn\u2019t. I made an excuse. Something about a prior commitment. It wasn\u2019t a lie, exactly, but it was\u2026 vague. And she seemed really disappointed. I could tell.

Was there a physical reaction \u2013 perhaps a tightening in your chest, a knot in your stomach, a racing heart? And importantly, *why* do you think that particular feeling was so distressing?

When I thought about it afterwards \u2013 and it was really unsettling \u2013 my chest felt\u2026 constricted. Like there was this pressure, this almost suffocating sensation. And my hands\u2026 they were clammy. I remember just wanting to disappear, you know? Like I was acutely aware of how *visible* I was, how much attention I was drawing to myself because of this failure. \n\nI think\u2026 I think the worst part wasn\u2019t necessarily the *doing* \u2013 saying I\u2019d do it. It was the *not*not* doing ite it, the feeling of letting her down. It's not about what happened, but about what *could have been*. The missed opportunity.

When did you first start feeling this way about yourself? Was there a particular event, a relationship, or perhaps a message you received early in your life that solidified this sense of inadequacy?

It doesn't have to be a dramatic event; sometimes the smallest judgments can have a lasting impact. What *feeling* did you experience in your body when that happened?

It\u2019s common for these deeply held beliefs to have their origins in childhood experiences, often without us even realizing it.\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment. Can you recall a time when someone \u2013 perhaps a parent, sibling, teacher, or caregiver \u2013 offered you feedback that felt particularly harsh, critical, or dismissive? It doesn't have to be a monumental event. Even a small, fleeting moment can hold significant weight.\n\nWhen you think about that moment, what\u2019s the *first* physical sensation you notice in your body? Don\u2019t try to analyze it\u2014just notice what you feel. Is it warmth, cold, tightness, looseness, a quickening, a slowing, or something else entirely?

Not a literal color, but a metaphorical color \u2013 does it feel like a dark, heavy color like grey or black? Or perhaps a brighter, more painful color like red or yellow?
