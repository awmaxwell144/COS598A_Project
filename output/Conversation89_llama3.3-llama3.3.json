Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

She always had this way of making me feel seen and heard, even when I felt like I was falling apart. *pauses, lost in thought* She'd probably remind me of all the times I've faced challenges before and come out stronger on the other side.

She'd also cook these amazing meals for our family, and the smell of her kitchen was just... *smiles* ...it was like home.\n\nI think what I miss the most about her is the way she made me feel seen and heard. She had this way of listening that made you feel like you were the only person in the world, and she'd always offer these words of wisdom that would make everything seem okay again.\n\nAs for activities or traditions we shared, I remember how much we loved watching old movies together. We'd have these marathon sessions where we'd watch classic films all day long, and she'd tell me stories about when she was younger and what it was like growing up. Those were always my favorite days.\n\nI think it would be really nice to start a garden of my own, maybe with some of the same flowers and vegetables that she used to grow.

I remember she had this one cookbook that was filled with notes and recipes that had been passed down from her own mother.

It's a way of honoring her legacy and keeping her memory close to your heart.

This could be something like lighting a candle or saying a prayer on certain days, or it could be something more creative like writing a letter or making a piece of art.\n\nYou could also think about reaching out to others who knew your mom and sharing stories and memories with them. This can be a great way to feel connected to her and to process your grief, and it can also help you to build relationships with others who are going through similar experiences.\n\n*Pauses for a moment* But I want to make sure that we're not overwhelming you with too many ideas or suggestions.
