Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

It\u2019s just\u2026 a feeling. Like I need to *do* something, but I don\u2019t know what. I find myself just\u2026 moving. Mostly pacing, I think. Just going back and forth.

Are there any particular memories or thoughts that trigger it?

It\u2019s not actively painful, but it\u2019s\u2026 draining. I just\u2026 feel\u2026 empty. And it makes me feel\u2026 useless, I suppose.

Let\u2019s unpack that shame a little further. When you say you\u2019re \u201cletting people down,\u201d who are you feeling this way about? Are there specific people in your life \u2013 family, friends, colleagues \u2013 that you feel this pressure from?

When you hear your father say \u201cYou have so much potential,\u201d what *specifically* does that make you *feel* inside of you? Is it hope, disappointment, anxiety \u2013 or perhaps a combination of these?

And the thought of him being disappointed\u2026 it\u2019s terrifying. It feels like\u2026 like he wouldn\u2019t love me anymore. Like he\u2019d see me as\u2026 a failure. And the thought of losing that\u2026 that\u2019s unbearable. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a really lonely feeling, actually. Like I'm carrying this weight alone."

    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "Thank you for being so open about that, Elias. That deep, lonely feeling of carrying this weight alone\u2026 it\u2019s a really significant and painful experience, and it\u2019s entirely understandable why you\u2019re struggling with this restlessness. You\u2019ve essentially created a powerful self-critical narrative \u2013 that your worth is contingent upon meeting your father's expectations, and that failing to do so will lead to a loss of love and acceptance. \n\nLet\u2019s examine this narrative a little further. Can you see how this narrative \u2013 that your worth is defined by external validation \u2013 might be contributing to your restlessness? When you feel the need to *do* something, is that driven by a genuine desire, or is it fueled by the underlying belief that you *must* achieve something to avoid disappointing your father? Let\u2019s think about that for a moment."
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "That\u2019s a very astute observation. It\u2019s often the case that we\u2019re not consciously aware of the underlying motivations driving our behavior. You\u2019ve accurately identified the core issue: you\u2019re operating under the assumption that your value is tied to meeting external expectations, and that this belief is fueling your restlessness.\n\nNow, let\u2019s shift our focus for a moment. Let's try a small exercise. I want you to imagine a scenario: your father *never* voiced these expectations. He didn\u2019t talk about \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201cachieving more.\u201d He simply\u2026 accepted you as you are. What would that feel like? What would you be doing instead of pacing, instead of feeling this pressure to *do*? Let's explore what your life might look like if you weren't carrying this burden."

    "content": "(He takes a deep breath, closing his eyes for a moment)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 peaceful. It\u2019s\u2026 quiet. There\u2019s no urgency. I\u2019d still\u2026 I\u2019d still be *doing* things, I suppose. I\u2019d probably be painting, like I used to. Just\u2026 for myself. Without worrying about whether anyone else would appreciate it. I'd spend time in the garden, just\u2026 being. And I wouldn\u2019t feel this\u2026 this need to *prove* myself. It feels\u2026 lighter. Like a weight has been lifted. It\u2019s\u2026 strangely comforting."

    "role": "patient",
    "content": "That\u2019s a remarkably insightful and important observation, Elias. You\u2019ve just experienced a glimpse of what your life *could* be like if you weren\u2019t operating under the weight of your father\u2019s expectations. You\u2019ve articulated a core desire \u2013 to create without judgment, to simply *be* \u2013 and recognized that this desire has been stifled by the pressure to meet external standards.\n\nLet\u2019s hold onto that feeling \u2013 that sense of lightness and freedom. It\u2019s a powerful reminder of your authentic self. Now, let\u2019s consider this: your father\u2019s expectations are *his* beliefs. They are *his* standards. They don\u2019t inherently define *you*. \n\nLet\u2019s explore this further. If you truly recognized that your worth isn\u2019t tied to meeting your father\u2019s expectations, what would you *choose* to value instead? What qualities, what activities, what relationships would you prioritize? Let\u2019s start with one thing \u2013 just one thing \u2013 that you would value simply *because* it brings you joy and fulfillment, regardless of anyone else\u2019s opinion."

  {
    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "(After a long pause, Elias speaks softly)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 connection. I think. I want to\u2026 be *present* with people. Really *present*. Not worrying about achieving anything, or measuring up, just\u2026 *being*. Sharing a laugh, a quiet moment, a simple connection. It feels\u2026 grounding. Like a safe place."
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "That\u2019s beautifully articulated, Elias. You've identified a profound and incredibly valuable core desire \u2013 a deep need for connection and authentic relationships. And it\u2019s remarkable because it\u2019s completely independent of your father\u2019s expectations. It\u2019s a desire rooted in your own inherent need for belonging and acceptance.\n\nWhat you've just described \u2013 a focus on genuine connection \u2013 is a powerful antidote to the self-critical narrative you've been carrying. It\u2019s a shift from seeking external validation to cultivating internal fulfillment.\n\nLet's explore this further. When you think about these connections \u2013 these moments of genuine connection \u2013 what does it *feel* like in your body? Can you describe the physical sensations you experience when you're in the midst of a truly meaningful connection with another person?"
