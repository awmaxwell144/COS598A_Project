You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Are there specific things you do \u2013 cleaning, organizing, reading \u2013 that you believe will help you \u201chold onto\u201d that feeling of safety and control? <<What is that you don\u2019t like about this feeling of needing to keep moving, and why?>>"

It's not just about *doing* the activities, but the *feeling* they provide \u2013 that sense of being anchored, of having a handle on things. It sounds like the act of maintaining order, of controlling your environment, is intrinsically linked to managing this underlying anxiety.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that a little further. When you say you feel \"anchored\" during these activities, can you describe what that *feels* like in your body? Is there a particular sensation \u2013 perhaps a tightening in your chest, a grounding in your feet, or something else entirely \u2013 that you experience when you\u2019re engaged in cleaning, organizing, or reading? <<What is that you don\u2019t like about this feeling of needing to keep moving, and why?>> It's about pinpointing the physical manifestation of this sense of security."

Do you notice any specific physical sensations \u2013 perhaps a tingling, a coldness, a tightness, or a feeling of disorientation?
