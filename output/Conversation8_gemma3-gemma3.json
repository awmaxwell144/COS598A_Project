Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

I\u2019ve been working in this field for nearly 15 years, and I truly believe in the power of understanding thoughts and behaviors to help people find a path towards greater well-being. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for support, and I want to acknowledge that you\u2019ve taken a significant step. \n\nTo start, could you tell me, what's brought you here today?

Like a sudden drop in the temperature, and you don't know *why* it\u2019s suddenly cold. It's the lack of control. \n\nIt happened last week. I was at my sister\u2019s place. We were playing cards, and I just\u2026 froze. I couldn't bring myself to put down my hand. I just stared at the cards, and I felt this immense pressure building up.

It sounds like that fear of judgment \u2013 of being seen as weak or vulnerable \u2013 is a central driver of this experience. And it\u2019s incredibly common, you know. Many people, especially men, feel immense pressure to appear strong and in control, and that can make it incredibly difficult to express vulnerability, even when it\u2019s a perfectly normal and understandable human emotion.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that a little more.

It\u2019s exactly the kind of thing someone would actually say in a real conversation.\n*   **Collaborative Tone:** Phrases like \"Let\u2019s go from there\" and \u201cinvite collaboration\u201d establish a friendly and engaging dynamic.\n*   **Focused Questioning:**  The final two questions (asking about preferred conversation types and goals) are *exactly* what's needed to move towards a productive and natural interaction.
