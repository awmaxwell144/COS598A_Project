Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

She was a quiet woman, but she always seemed to be observing. She\u2019d give me these little smiles, but they felt\u2026 critical, too. Like she was judging my choices, even when she wasn\u2019t saying anything. It was like there was this constant feeling of\u2026 being evaluated. Like a spotlight was always on me, and I was being judged.\u201d \n\n(A long, quiet sigh)\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just him, though. It was the whole atmosphere. It felt like everyone always wanted more. More success, more money, more *everything*. It was like\u2026 I was expected to keep up, but I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t.\u201d"

Thank you for sharing that with such honesty and vulnerability. It\u2019s clear that these weren't just casual comments or fleeting judgments; they were deeply ingrained, formative experiences that have shaped your sense of self-worth.\n\nWhat you\u2019ve described \u2013 this constant pressure to meet an unattainable standard, this feeling of being perpetually \"not enough\" \u2013 it\u2019s a remarkably common experience, particularly for those who grew up in environments that valued achievement and outward success above all else. But that doesn't diminish the profound impact it\u2019s had on you. \n\nIt's fascinating to hear about the role your father and grandmother played in shaping this belief. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that their intentions might not have been malicious, but the effect of their actions \u2013 the constant measurement, the unspoken expectations \u2013 has been incredibly damaging. \n\nNow, let\u2019s gently begin to untangle this. We\u2019ve identified a key element \u2013 this deeply ingrained belief that you\u2019re \u201cnot enough.\u201d It\u2019s a powerful narrative, and one that has been with you for a long time. \n\nBut what if we started to challenge that narrative? What if we began to question the validity of that belief? It\u2019s not about denying your father\u2019s or grandmother\u2019s influence, but about recognizing that their standards \u2013 and the values they represented \u2013 don't necessarily reflect *your* worth. \n\nCan you imagine, just for a moment, saying to yourself, \u201cI don\u2019t have to meet *their* standards. I get to define my own worth.\u201d It\u2019s a radical thought, isn\u2019t it? \n\nThere's no pressure to immediately embrace this idea, but let's simply explore the *possibility* \u2013 the idea that you are inherently worthy, simply because you *are*.\""

For so long, it\u2019s been this\u2026 this silent current running beneath everything. The striving, the pushing, the constant self-criticism\u2026 it\u2019s all been fueled by this single, unspoken expectation. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right. The striving\u2026 it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like running a race against an invisible opponent, a race I was always destined to lose. \n\nWhen you say \u201csimply explore the possibility\u2026 the idea that you are inherently worthy, simply because you *are*,\u201d\u2026 it feels\u2026 strange. Like a foreign concept. For so long, my worth was entirely contingent on achievement, on external validation. It\u2019s\u2026 terrifying to even consider that I might be inherently worthy, without having to *do* anything to earn it. \n\n(Another long silence, a shift in posture, a small, hesitant movement)\n\n\u2026It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a beginning, isn\u2019t it? Just a tiny, fragile beginning. Thank you for saying that. Thank you for creating this space, this\u2026 this quiet space to simply *be*, without judgment, without expectation. It\u2019s\u2026 incredibly liberating, just to hear you say that."

It's like dismantling a carefully constructed fortress\u2014it\u2019s uncomfortable, but ultimately, it's the foundation for building something new. \n\nYou\u2019ve articulated a core truth\u2014that your worth was previously tied to external achievements, a standard set by others. That\u2019s a significant realization, and a critical first step in reclaiming your sense of self-worth.\n\nLet\u2019s gently explore that further. You\u2019ve said this belief was \u201cfueled by others.\u201d Let's talk about the *impact* of those expectations. When you were confronted with those expectations \u2013 whether it was your father\u2019s criticisms or the broader societal pressures \u2013 how did that *feel* in your body? Did you notice any physical sensations \u2013 tension, tightness, a knot in your stomach?\n\nSimply noticing those sensations, acknowledging them, can be a powerful tool. It's a way of saying, \"I am experiencing this, and it is valid.\" There's no need to fix it, no need to change it. Just\u2026 notice it."
