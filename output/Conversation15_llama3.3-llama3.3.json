Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

It's as if the flavor and pleasure have been taken out of these experiences for you right now.\n\nCan you help me understand what specifically about cooking (or other activities you used to enjoy) feels so different now?

It's as if the routine of cooking, which was once a way to share and connect with your mom, now serves as a painful reminder of her absence.\n\nI want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit and feel this depth of emotion. It's okay to feel this way, and it's okay to grieve the loss of those everyday moments you shared with your mom.\n\nCan you tell me more about what goes through your mind when you're standing in the kitchen, waiting for her to walk in, but she doesn't?

It's clear that she had a profound impact on your life, and it's okay to acknowledge and honor those feelings.\n\nI want to explore this idea of \"waiting for her to come back\" a bit further. What do you think is driving that sense of waiting? Is it a hope that she'll somehow return, or is it more about holding onto the memories and feelings you had when she was with you? Are there any specific rituals, habits, or routines that you've been holding onto since her passing that might be contributing to this sense of waiting?\n\n*Leans forward slightly, eyes locked on yours* I'm here to support you in navigating these complex emotions, and I want to help you find ways to honor your mom's memory while also moving forward in a way that feels authentic to you.

The weight you described feeling in your body is a common physical manifestation of grief, and it can be really debilitating.\n\n*I take a moment to acknowledge the emotional pain* I want to acknowledge how hard it must be for you to navigate these feelings, especially when it comes to social interactions.

It was such a small thing, but it made me feel so important and included.\n\n*I pause, reflecting on the emotions* Cooking that dish again might be a way for me to recapture some of those feelings and memories. And who knows, maybe it'll even taste like she's still with me, cooking in the kitchen.\n\n*I look up, meeting your gaze* You asked how I think my mom would want me to remember her... *I take a moment to collect my thoughts* I think she'd want me to remember her as a strong, loving person who always put others first. She had this incredible ability to make everyone feel seen and heard, and I think that's something I can continue to honor in my own life.\n\n*I nod slightly, feeling a sense of determination* I'd like to start by cooking her chicken parmesan recipe again, and see where it takes me.
