Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

I\u2019ve been working in this field for over ten years, helping people understand and manage their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It's really wonderful to meet you, and I want to assure you that this is a safe and confidential space for us to explore what\u2019s going on. \n\nTo start, could you tell me, what\u2019s bringing you here today?

When you say you\u2019re \u201cdoing little things just to *something*,\u201d could you describe what those little things are?

When you\u2019re actively cleaning, what thoughts or feelings are you experiencing *in the moment*? Are you feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or perhaps something else entirely?

Can you pinpoint a specific event, thought, or situation that tends to set off this behavior? It doesn't need to be a huge, dramatic thing.

You mentioned that you\u2019re struggling to sit still, and I'm wondering if this might be related to your sleep. How would you rate your sleep quality lately \u2013 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very poor and 10 being excellent?

When you say \u201cdifficult,\u201d what specifically makes your sleep *difficult*? Is it difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or perhaps something else entirely \u2013 like feeling restless or anxious while you\u2019re trying to sleep?

You mentioned feeling restless and anxious while trying to sleep. Can you describe what that feeling *feels like* specifically? Is it a racing heart, a sense of panic, or perhaps just a persistent feeling of unease? And *what is that you don\u2019t like about this feeling, and why?* What's the worst-case scenario you're trying to avoid when you\u2019re struggling to sleep?"

It doesn't have to be a traumatic event, but it's possible you've developed this instinct through experience. It's not about blaming yourself or your past; it\u2019s about exploring the origins of this automatic response. Is there *anything* that comes to mind when you consider this?
