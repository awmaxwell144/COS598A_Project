Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

They're experiencing symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite/weight.

They also want the patient to relate symptoms to life experiences without using professional terms.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure the patient's response is concise, vague, and colloquial.

The patient might be confused about their feelings, so the response should reflect that confusion.\n\nIn the previous interaction, the therapist asked about the emotions and how long they've been present. The patient's response was about feeling like they're \"stuck in a loop\" with a \"dull hum\" in their chest, which relates to restlessness or emotional dysregulation. The therapist then asked about the duration and how it's affecting daily life. The patient mentioned feeling like they can't focus on anything, which points to difficulty concentrating. \n\nNow, the patient needs to address another symptom, perhaps fatigue or changes in appetite. They should tie it to a recent event without naming it. The response should be brief, using everyday language. For example, talking about not being able to enjoy food or feeling physically drained. The patient might also express confusion about why these feelings are happening, linking it to the recent event. \n\nI need to ensure the patient doesn't mention depression explicitly but instead uses phrases like \"feeling numb\" or \"not being able to enjoy things.\" The patient's confusion about the event should come through, showing they don't fully understand the cause.
