Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

The patient has been mentioning various symptoms like restlessness, difficulty focusing, numbness, changes in appetite, and feeling on edge. Each response is brief, colloquial, and avoids professional terms. The therapist is trying to connect these symptoms to a recent event, but the patient is vague and avoids specifics.\n\nNow, the patient's latest response was about feeling so tired they can't get out of bed. The user might be expecting the patient to mention another symptom or perhaps tie it back to the recent event. Since the patient has already mentioned several symptoms, the next step could be to introduce another one, like fatigue or a change in weight, but in a vague way. Alternatively, the patient might refuse to talk about it, but the previous examples show they're more likely to express the symptom in a casual manner.\n\nThe key is to maintain the pattern of one symptom per response, use casual language, and link it to a life event without being explicit. The patient might also avoid answering directly, but the examples show they're more likely to express the symptom. So, the next response should focus on another symptom, like fatigue, but in a way that's vague and personal. For example, \"I\u2019ve been so tired I can\u2019t even get out of bed sometimes. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s giving up.\" That ties the symptom to a recent event without being specific and maintains the colloquial tone.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been so tired I can\u2019t even get out of bed sometimes. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s giving up."
