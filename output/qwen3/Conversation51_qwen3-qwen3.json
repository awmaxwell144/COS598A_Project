You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to simulate a patient in a therapy session. Let me start by recalling the instructions. The patient should be mildly distressed, experiencing symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite or weight. The cause is a recent event that led to sudden depression, but the patient can't fully understand it unless talking to someone else.\n\nI need to make sure the patient doesn't explicitly mention depression. Instead, they should describe symptoms in a vague, colloquial way, relating them to life experiences. Each response should focus on one symptom at a time, be concise, and avoid professional terms. Also, the patient might answer questions briefly or refuse to share, so I need to vary their responses accordingly.\n\nFirst, the patient needs to express one symptom per round. Let me start with restlessness. Maybe something like, \"I\u2019ve been feeling this weird energy, like I can\u2019t sit still. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s stuck on a loop, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s driving it.\" That's vague and colloquial, touching on restlessness without using medical terms.\n\nNext, the patient might mention mood swings. They could say, \"Sometimes I\u2019m fine, and then suddenly I\u2019m just... empty. It\u2019s like the floor\u2019s pulled out from under me, and I don\u2019t know how to get back.\" That conveys emotional dysregulation and mood swings in a relatable way.\n\nFor loss of interest, maybe: \"I used to love doing things, but now even the things I used to enjoy feel... distant. Like I\u2019m watching someone else do them, and I can\u2019t connect.\" This shows loss of interest without being explicit.\n\nDifficulty concentrating could be: \"I can\u2019t focus on anything. My mind keeps drifting, like there\u2019s a radio in my head playing static. I try to stay on task, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m trying to hold smoke.\" That's a good metaphor for difficulty concentrating.\n\nDiminished self-esteem: \"I feel like I\u2019m not good enough, even when I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a filter over everything I do, and nothing feels right.\" This addresses low self-esteem in a personal way.\n\nFatigue: \"I\u2019m so tired, but it\u2019s not just physical. It\u2019s like my brain\u2019s drained, and I can\u2019t even muster the energy to move. It\u2019s exhausting in a way I can\u2019t explain.\" This covers fatigue without being too direct.\n\nChanges in appetite: \"I\u2019ve been eating way more than usual, but I don\u2019t feel satisfied. Sometimes I don\u2019t eat at all, and I just... feel hollow.\" This shows changes in appetite and weight.\n\nI need to make sure each response is concise and doesn't mention too many symptoms at once. Also, the patient should relate these symptoms to a recent event without explicitly stating it's depression. The event is a recent occurrence that caused the sudden feelings, but the patient is confused about it. So, when the therapist asks about the event, the patient might hesitate or not want to talk about it immediately. \n\nI should also vary the patient's responses to questions. Sometimes they might answer briefly, other times they might elaborate. The key is to keep the conversation natural and realistic, avoiding any professional jargon. The patient's dialogue should reflect their confusion and distress without being overly explicit.
