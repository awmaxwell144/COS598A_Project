You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time.

Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

The user wants a friendly and empathetic tone, so I'll make sure to keep it warm and approachable.\n\nFirst, the introduction: \"Hi, I'm Dr. Elena Marquez, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy. I focus on helping individuals navigate emotional challenges and build healthier coping strategies.\" That covers the necessary details.\n\nNext, the question about why they're here. I should phrase it in a way that invites them to share without pressure. Maybe something like, \"I\u2019d love to hear more about what brought you here today. Are you experiencing any specific concerns or changes in your life that you\u2019d like to explore?\" This keeps the door open for them to explain their situation.\n\nWait, the user mentioned using the laddering technique and in-depth questions. But since this is the first session, maybe I should start with a general question to get them comfortable. The user also wants the questions to cover emotion, sleep, weight, appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. However, in the first session, it's better to start with a broad question to allow them to open up. So the initial question should be about their current situation without diving into specifics yet. \n\nI need to make sure the introduction is concise and the question is open-ended. Let me check the example response again. Oh right, the user provided an example where the therapist starts with a friendly intro and then asks about the reason for coming. So I should follow that structure. \n\nI think that's all. The introduction is clear, and the question invites them to share their concerns. No need to go into specific aspects yet. Let me make sure the language is warm and supportive.\n</think>\n\nHi, I\u2019m Dr. Elena Marquez, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to simulate a patient who's feeling distressed but not explicitly stating depression. They mentioned symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite/weight. The key is to not mention too many symptoms at once, only one per round. Also, the patient is confused about why they're feeling this way, tied to a recent event they can't fully understand yet. They should express symptoms vaguely, relate them to life experiences, and avoid professional terms. The patient might answer questions or refuse to talk about it. Need to keep responses concise and colloquial.\n\nFirst, the patient's response should be brief and vague. Maybe start with a symptom like restlessness. Use casual language, like \"I\u2019ve been feeling... like I can\u2019t settle.\" Then, when asked about the cause, they might mention a recent event without specifics. The therapist's next question should encourage more details without pushing too hard. Need to make sure the patient's answers are fragmented, each focusing on a single symptom. Avoid using terms like \"depression\" or \"mood swings\" explicitly. Instead, use phrases like \"feeling off\" or \"can\u2019t focus.\" Also, the patient might not want to reveal feelings easily, so some answers should be brief or non-committal. Keep the dialogue natural, as if a real patient would speak. Make sure each response is concise, maybe a sentence or two, and relate symptoms to daily life without over-explaining. Check that the patient's answers don't list multiple symptoms at once. The therapist's questions should gently probe without being pushy. Alright, time to structure the patient's first response.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling... like I can\u2019t settle. Like I\u2019m stuck in this loop of things I used to enjoy, but now they just... fade. It\u2019s weird. Like I\u2019m watching myself from outside, but I can\u2019t reach in."

    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me break this down. The patient mentioned feeling stuck in a loop of things they used to enjoy but now fade, and they feel like they're watching themselves from outside. That's a classic sign of emotional detachment or depersonalization, which can be linked to anxiety or depression. They also mentioned not being able to reach in, which might indicate a sense of disconnection from their own emotions or self.\n\nNext, I need to ask about the duration of these feelings. The patient might not know exactly how long it's been, but it's important to establish a timeline. Also, the cause is unclear, so I should ask about any recent events or changes in their life that might have triggered this. They mentioned a recent event they can't fully understand, so prodding gently about that could help uncover underlying issues.\n\nI should also explore specific manifestations of the symptoms. For example, the patient said things they used to enjoy now fade\u2014maybe they can't explain why. I should ask about specific activities or situations that used to bring them joy but now don't. This can help identify patterns or triggers.\n\nThe patient's answer was brief, so I need to make sure the next question is open-ended but not overwhelming. Maybe start with the duration to get a sense of how long this has been happening. That way, the patient can reflect without feeling pressured to dive into details immediately. Also, the patient might not want to talk about it, so the question should be gentle and non-intrusive. \n\nI should avoid using professional terms and keep the language casual. The patient's response was fragmented, so the next question should encourage them to elaborate without forcing it. The goal is to build trust and make the patient feel comfortable enough to share more. \n\nI need to check if the patient's answers are focusing on one symptom at a time. The previous response mentioned restlessness and feeling disconnected, so the next question should address the duration to understand the context. This will help in determining if the symptoms are acute or have been ongoing, which is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. \n\nAlso, the patient mentioned a recent event they can't fully understand. I should ask about that event without being pushy, maybe by asking if there's something specific that happened recently that stands out. This can help uncover potential stressors or triggers that the patient might not have considered. \n\nOverall, the approach should be empathetic, encouraging the patient to feel safe to share without judgment. The questions need to be concise, focused on one aspect at a time, and designed to gather information without overwhelming the patient. This way, the patient can gradually open up and provide more detailed insights into their experiences.\n</think>\n\nHow long has this feeling been happening? Like, when did it start?"
