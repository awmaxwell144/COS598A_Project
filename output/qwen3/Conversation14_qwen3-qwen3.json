Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

Let me start with that.\n\nI should use a friendly and empathetic tone. Maybe start with \"Hello, I'm Dr. Anna Smith, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.\" That sounds good. \n\nNext, I need to ask why they're here. The user mentioned they want to understand the reason for their distress. So, I should phrase it in a way that invites them to share without pressure. Maybe something like, \"Can you tell me what brought you here today, and what's been on your mind lately?\" \n\nWait, the user also wants the questions to cover emotion, sleep, weight, appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. But the initial introduction is just about setting up the session. I should make sure to ask one question at a time, starting with the reason for coming. \n\nI need to check if I'm following the guidelines correctly. The user specified to ask one question at a time, so after the introduction, the next question should be about the reason they're here. Then proceed to the other aspects as the conversation progresses. \n\nAlso, the user wants in-depth questions using the laddering technique. But for the first question, it's just about the reason for coming. I should keep it open-ended to encourage them to share more. \n\nI think that's covered. The introduction is done, and the next step is to ask about their reason for being here. Let me make sure the response is concise and matches the user's request.\n</think>\n\nHello, I\u2019m Dr. Anna Smith, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Let me make sure I follow the guidelines.\n\nFirst, the patient should express confusion about their feelings without explicitly stating depression. They need to mention one symptom per round, in a vague and colloquial way. The recent event causing the symptoms isn't clear, so the patient should hint at it without revealing too much.\n\nIn the previous response, the patient mentioned feeling \"unmoored\" and \"like the ground\u2019s been pulled out,\" which aligns with restlessness and emotional dysregulation. Now, the next step is to introduce another symptom. The user specified not to mention multiple symptoms at once, so I need to pick one. \n\nLooking at the symptoms list: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite/weight. The patient already touched on emotional dysregulation and restlessness. Next, maybe fatigue or changes in appetite. But the user wants the patient to relate to life experiences. \n\nThe patient mentioned feeling \"like the ground\u2019s been pulled out\" and \"tangled up in my own head.\" Maybe the next symptom could be fatigue, but the user wants it in a vague way. Alternatively, loss of interest. Let me check the previous example. The user's example had the patient mention feeling \"unmoored\" and \"tangled up,\" which were emotional dysregulation and restlessness. The next symptom could be fatigue, but phrased as \"tired all the time, even when I don\u2019t do much.\" That's concise and vague. \n\nWait, the user said to avoid professional terms and use colloquial language. So \"tired all the time\" works. Also, the patient should relate it to life experiences. Maybe the fatigue is from not sleeping well, which ties into the previous mention of feeling \"tangled up.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the patient is struggling with concentration. The user's example had the patient mention feeling \"like the ground\u2019s been pulled out,\" which is more about emotional instability. The next symptom could be difficulty concentrating, phrased as \"can\u2019t focus on anything, even when I want to.\" That's concise and vague. \n\nBut the user wants the patient to mention the recent event causing the symptoms. The patient hasn't explicitly mentioned the event yet, so they might hint at it indirectly. For example, if the event is a job loss or a relationship issue, the symptoms could be tied to that. But the patient should not explicitly state the event. \n\nIn the previous response, the patient mentioned feeling \"like the ground\u2019s been pulled out,\" which could hint at a recent upheaval. The next symptom could be fatigue, which might be related to stress from that event. \n\nSo, the patient's next response should mention fatigue, phrased in a vague way, and link it to their current state without naming the event. Let me make sure it's concise and follows the guidelines. \n\nFinal check: one symptom per round, vague, colloquial, related to life experiences, no professional terms. Yes, \"tired all the time, even when I don\u2019t do much\" fits. That's the next symptom. The patient is trying to make sense of their feelings, so the response should reflect that confusion without being too direct.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been\u2026 tired all the time, even when I don\u2019t do much.
