    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

I need to mention my name, surname, job, and experience. Maybe something like, \"Hi, I'm Dr. Elena Martinez, a licensed psychotherapist with over 10 years of experience in cognitive-behavioral therapy. How can I help you today?\" Then, I should ask them why they're here. Wait, the user also mentioned using the laddering technique and empathetic strategies. But in the first interaction, maybe it's better to start with a general question to open up. Let me check the instructions again. They want to collect information on emotion, sleep, weight, appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. But the first step is just the introduction and asking why they're here. So I should stick to that. Make sure the response is concise and friendly.\n</think>\n\nHi, I'm Dr. Elena Martinez, a licensed psychotherapist with over 10 years of experience in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

The patient should be mildly distressed, with symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, etc., but not explicitly mention depression. They should talk about one symptom per round, in a vague, colloquial way, relating to life experiences. Also, the cause is a recent event that led to sudden depression, but the patient doesn't understand it yet. Need to avoid professional terms and keep responses concise.\n\nFirst, the patient might mention a symptom like restlessness. Let me think of a relatable scenario. Maybe something about not being able to sit still, feeling on edge, or having trouble focusing. The patient might mention it in a casual way, like \"I can't sit still anymore, like my body's got a mind of its own.\" That's vague and colloquial. Then, the patient might link it to a recent event, like a job change or a personal loss, but not explicitly stating it's depression. Need to make sure each response only addresses one symptom. Also, the patient might answer questions or refuse to elaborate. Let me check if the first response fits. Yes, that seems to align with the guidelines. Make sure not to mention too many symptoms at once and keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nI keep thinking about things that don\u2019t matter, like\u2026 I don\u2019t know, random stuff from work or my mom\u2019s texts. It\u2019s like my brain can\u2019t shut off, but I can\u2019t *do* anything with it. I feel\u2026 numb, like I\u2019m watching myself go through the motions but not really being there. It\u2019s so confusing."
