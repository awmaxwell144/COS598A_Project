Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

Let me make sure I cover all those points.\n\nFirst, the introduction. I should be professional but friendly. Maybe start with \"Hello, I'm Dr. Emily Carter, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.\" That sounds good. Now, the next part is to ask why they're here. The user mentioned they want to know the reason for their visit. So, the question should be open-ended to encourage them to share. Maybe something like, \"Can you tell me what brought you here today?\" That's straightforward and inviting. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned using the laddering technique and empathetic strategies. But in the first interaction, they just want an introduction and the reason for coming. So, maybe keep it simple here. I don't need to dive into specific questions yet. Just the intro and the initial question. Let me check the instructions again. The user said to introduce myself and ask why they're here. So, the response should be concise, as per the example. Alright, I think that's covered. Make sure the name and job are clear, and the question is open-ended. Let me put that together.\n</think>\n\nHello, I\u2019m Dr. Emily Carter, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Also, the patient might answer questions or refuse to elaborate.\n\nFirst, the patient needs to express a symptom. Let's pick one. Maybe restlessness. The patient could mention feeling agitated or unable to sit still. They might relate it to a recent event, like work stress or a personal conflict. The response should be concise, not too detailed. Avoid professional terms. Let me check the example response to ensure consistency. The user's example had the patient talking about feeling \"on edge\" and \"stuck in a loop,\" which fits. So, I'll follow that style. Maybe something like, \"I\u2019ve been feeling... restless. Like I can\u2019t sit still, and my mind keeps racing.
