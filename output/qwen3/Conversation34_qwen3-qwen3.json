Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Let me make sure to include all the required elements.\n\nFirst, the introduction: I should mention my name, surname, job title, and experience. Maybe something like, \"Hi, I'm Dr. Emily Carter, a licensed psychotherapist with over 10 years of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.\" That covers the name, job, and experience.\n\nNext, the question about why they're here. The user mentioned they're doing their first assessment, so I need to ask in a way that's open-ended and inviting. Maybe, \"Can you tell me what brought you here today?\" That's concise and allows them to share their reasons without feeling pressured.\n\nWait, the user also specified to ask one question at a time. So after the introduction, the next step is to ask why they're here. Let me check if the introduction is clear and friendly. Using \"Hi\" makes it approachable. The experience part is important to build trust. \n\nI should avoid any jargon and keep the tone empathetic. The question should encourage them to share their concerns. Maybe add a bit of support, like \"I'm here to help you explore...\" to show willingness to assist. \n\nDouble-checking the structure: introduction first, then the question. No markdown, just plain text. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\nHi, I\u2019m Dr. Emily Carter, a licensed psychotherapist with over 10 years of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy. I\u2019m here to help you explore your thoughts, feelings, and experiences in a safe, supportive space. Can you tell me what brought you here today?"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to simulate a patient's response to the therapist's initial question. Let me start by recalling the guidelines. The patient should be mildly distressed, experiencing symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, etc., but not explicitly mention depression. They should talk about a recent event causing sudden feelings, but not clearly understand it. Symptoms should be mentioned one at a time, in a vague, colloquial way, related to life experiences. Avoid professional terms, be concise, and maybe answer questions or refuse briefly.\n\nFirst, the patient needs to respond to the therapist's question: \"Can you tell me what brought you here today?\" The patient should mention a recent event that caused their symptoms without being specific. Let me think of a plausible event. Maybe something like a job change, a relationship issue, or a personal loss. But since the user mentioned the event is recent and caused sudden depression-like feelings, maybe a job loss or a breakup. However, the patient should not explicitly say they're depressed. \n\nThe patient's response should reflect confusion about their feelings. Let me pick a symptom, like restlessness. They might say something like, \"I\u2019ve been feeling really restless lately, like I can\u2019t sit still or focus. It\u2019s been messing with my work.\" That's vague, colloquial, and ties to a life experience. They mention restlessness, which is one of the symptoms, and relate it to work, which is a common context. \n\nWait, the user said to not mention too many symptoms at once. So the patient should only mention one symptom per round. The example response uses restlessness. That fits. The patient might also mention other symptoms in subsequent rounds, but in this first response, just one. \n\nI should make sure the patient doesn't use professional terms. \"Restlessness\" is okay, but maybe \"can\u2019t sit still\" is more colloquial. The patient might also express confusion about their feelings, like not understanding why they feel this way. \n\nAnother angle: the patient could mention mood swings. For example, \"I\u2019ve been swinging between feeling really low and then suddenly... I don\u2019t know, just... empty.\" That's vague and relates to emotional dysregulation. \n\nBut the user specified the event caused sudden feelings, so the patient might not know why. Maybe they mention a recent event, like a project at work going wrong, leading to restlessness. \n\nI need to make sure the patient's response is concise, as per the instructions. Let me draft a response that includes one symptom, relates it to a life experience, and shows confusion. \n\nFinal check: no mention of depression, one symptom, colloquial language, and a vague reference to the event. Alright, that should work.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling... off, like I can\u2019t focus on anything. My brain just... zigs and zags, and I can\u2019t keep up. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this loop where nothing makes sense. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the work project I messed up, or something else. I just... feel like I\u2019m drowning in my own thoughts."
