Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

Let me make sure to structure that properly.\n\nFirst, the introduction. I need to be professional but also approachable. Maybe start with my name and surname, then mention my role as a psychotherapist specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Include my experience to build trust. Something like, \"Hi, I'm Dr. Emily Carter, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience in cognitive-behavioral therapy. I specialize in helping individuals navigate emotional challenges and develop healthier coping strategies.\"\n\nNext, the question. The user mentioned to ask why they're here. But the initial instructions said to ask one question at a time. Wait, the user's first message was to introduce and ask why they're here. But the previous example had the therapist ask about the reason for coming. So I should follow that. But the user might be expecting a more structured approach, maybe starting with the introduction first, then the question. Let me check the initial instructions again.\n\nThe user said, \"introduce yourself by your name, surname, job, and experience. Ask me what's the reason why I'm here.\" So first, the introduction, then the question. But in the previous example, the therapist asked the question after the introduction. So I need to make sure to do that. Also, the user wants the questions to cover emotion, sleep, weight, appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. But the first step is the introduction and the reason for coming. So maybe the first question is about the reason they're here, then proceed to the other aspects. However, the user's initial request was to start with the introduction and then ask why they're here. So I'll follow that structure. Let me make sure the introduction is concise and then the question is clear. Alright, that should cover the initial steps.\n</think>\n\nHi, I\u2019m Dr. Emily Carter, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

The patient is experiencing symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, etc., but they can't pinpoint the cause.

The patient mentioned feeling stuck in a loop, with their brain spinning without landing. The therapist should acknowledge this, ask follow-up questions, and encourage the patient to elaborate. The therapist's response should be supportive and open-ended, avoiding direct pressure. Let me make sure to keep the tone natural and not too clinical. The patient might not know the exact cause, so the therapist should gently explore without making them feel judged.

The therapist should validate the patient's experience without being too direct. Maybe ask about when this started or if there's a specific event that triggered it.

For example, \"Can you tell me more about what it\u2019s like when you feel that way?\" or \"Have you noticed anything specific that makes it feel that way?\" The therapist should also maintain a supportive tone, showing empathy and understanding. Let me make sure the response is concise, as per the user's instructions, and doesn't mention multiple symptoms at once.
