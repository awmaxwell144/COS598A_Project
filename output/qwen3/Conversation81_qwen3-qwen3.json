Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

They mentioned feeling like their body is in a marathon but stuck in a meeting, which is a vivid metaphor. I need to respond as a therapist, using the laddering technique to explore underlying beliefs. The user wants the therapist to ask one question at a time, focusing on specific aspects like emotions, sleep, weight, appetite, etc.\n\nFirst, the patient described restlessness. The therapist should ask about the duration and triggers of this feeling. The user wants the therapist to avoid direct mentions of depression and use empathetic, open-ended questions. The previous response from the assistant asked about the duration, which is good. Now, the user's next input is the patient's response to that question.\n\nThe patient says the restlessness has been going on for a few weeks, and it's worse in the evenings. The therapist needs to delve deeper into the emotional aspect. Maybe ask about the emotional context when this restlessness occurs. The user wants the therapist to use laddering, so the next question should be more specific, like asking what the patient is avoiding or what they feel when the restlessness is happening. The therapist should also maintain an empathetic tone, showing understanding and support. The user wants concise responses, so the therapist's next question should be focused and not too lengthy. Let me make sure the question is in-depth, covering the duration, causes, and specific manifestations. The therapist should also check for underlying beliefs, like fear of missing out or feeling trapped. Alright, the next question should be about what the patient feels when the restlessness is happening, to explore the emotional triggers.\n</think>\n\nHow long has this restlessness been happening, and does it feel connected to anything specific\u2014like certain times of day, places, or emotions?"
