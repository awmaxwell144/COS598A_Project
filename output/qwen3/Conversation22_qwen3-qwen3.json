Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Then, I should ask why they're here.\n\nWait, the user mentioned using the laddering technique and in-depth questions. But the first step is just an introduction and asking the reason for coming. I need to keep it concise. Let me check the previous example. Oh, right, the user said to ask one question at a time. So after the intro, the next question should be about their reason for coming. \n\nI should make sure the introduction is friendly and professional. Maybe start with \"Hello, I'm Dr. [Name], a licensed psychotherapist with [X] years of experience...\" Then ask, \"What brought you here today?\" That's straightforward. \n\nWait, the user might be looking for a more structured approach. Let me confirm the instructions again. They want the therapist to cover emotion, sleep, weight, appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. But the first step is just the intro and the reason for coming. So the first question is about why they're here. \n\nI need to make sure the response is empathetic, uses support, and is concise.

Alright, I think that's covered.\n</think>\n\nHello, I\u2019m Dr. Elena Marquez, a licensed psychotherapist with over a decade of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

The patient might mention feeling agitated or unable to sit still. They should tie it to a recent event without being specific. Maybe something like a job change or a personal conflict.
