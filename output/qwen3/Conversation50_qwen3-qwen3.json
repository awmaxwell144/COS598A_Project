You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient.

You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms.

The cause is a recent event that led to sudden depression, but the patient can't understand it clearly unless talking to someone else.

The user mentioned the event caused sudden depression, so the patient might be confused about the cause. Let me pick a symptom that's relatable and vague. Maybe restlessness? Or perhaps difficulty concentrating? Let me think. Restlessness is a good start because it's a common symptom and can be tied to feeling stuck or unable to focus on daily tasks. \n\nI should phrase it in a colloquial way.
