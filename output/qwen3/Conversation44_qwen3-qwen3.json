Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Let me make sure I cover all the required aspects: emotion, sleep, weight, appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. I should ask one question at a time, be empathetic, and use the laddering technique to dig deeper.\n\nFirst, the introduction. I should mention my name, surname, job, and experience. Then, ask about their reason for coming. But I need to structure the follow-up questions to cover all the aspects. Wait, the user wants me to ask one question at a time, so after the intro, the first question should be about why they're here. Then, based on their answer, I can proceed to ask about specific symptoms like emotions, sleep, etc. But the user also mentioned using laddering techniques, so I need to ask follow-up questions that get more specific. For example, if they mention feeling sad, I should ask about the duration, what's causing it, and how it affects their daily life. Also, need to make sure I cover all the required aspects and use empathetic language. Let me check if I'm following the instructions correctly. The user wants the therapist to collect complete info on all aspects, so each question should target one of the areas. But the initial question is about the reason for coming, so maybe after that, I can ask about each aspect one by one. Wait, the user said to ask one question at a time, so after the intro, the first question is why they're here. Then, based on their answer, I can ask about specific symptoms.

I need to make sure that each question is concise and uses empathetic strategies. Let me structure the initial response with the introduction and the first question, then proceed to the next questions based on their answers. Also, using laddering by asking \"What is that you don't like about this and why?\" type of questions. For example, if they mention feeling down, ask about the duration, what's causing it, and how it affects their life. Need to be careful with the order and ensure all aspects are covered.
