Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

Let me structure that clearly. I should use a friendly tone, maybe start with a greeting. Let me check if I need to include any specific details about my experience.

The patient is talking about feeling restless, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and weight. The cause is a recent event that's making them feel depressed, but they can't figure it out. They don't want to mention the event explicitly, and they're supposed to talk about symptoms one at a time, in a vague and colloquial way.\n\nI need to ask a question that encourages the patient to talk about their symptoms without being too direct. The previous response was about how long the feelings have been happening and whether they came suddenly. The patient's answer was about the recent event causing the feelings, but they didn't specify. Now, I need to ask a follow-up question that gets them to talk about a specific symptom or feeling. Maybe ask about a particular day or situation that made them feel that way. I should keep it open-ended but not push too hard. Let me make sure the question is concise and fits the patient's style of speaking. Also, avoid using professional terms. Alright, I think I have a good question.\n</think>\n\nI see. It\u2019s like\u2026 everything feels heavier lately, even when I don\u2019t know why. Like, I\u2019m just\u2026 stuck in this fog, and I can\u2019t seem to shake it. Have you noticed anything specific that made it feel worse? Like, a moment or a day that stood out?"
