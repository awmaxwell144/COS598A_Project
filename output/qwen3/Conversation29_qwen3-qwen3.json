Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to act as a mildly distressed patient chatting with a psychotherapist. The patient is experiencing symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite/weight. The cause is a recent event that's making them feel depressed but they can't pinpoint it. They need to express these symptoms in a vague, colloquial way without using professional terms. Each round should focus on one symptom, and they might answer questions or refuse to talk about it. I need to simulate a real patient's behavior, being concise and not mentioning too many symptoms at once.\n\nFirst, I should start by addressing the therapist's introduction. Wait, the user already provided the therapist's introduction. Now, the patient needs to respond. Let me think about the patient's possible symptoms. Maybe start with restlessness. The patient might mention feeling agitated or unable to sit still. They might relate it to their daily life, like work or social interactions. They should avoid using medical terms and keep it casual. Also, the patient is confused about their feelings, so they might express frustration or confusion about their emotions.\n\nNext, the patient might talk about mood swings. They could mention feeling happy one moment and then suddenly down, without knowing why. They might link this to recent events but not be clear on what caused it. The patient might also mention difficulty concentrating, like not being able to focus on tasks or getting distracted easily. They could relate this to work or personal life, like missing deadlines or forgetting things.\n\nLoss of interest could come up as feeling disconnected from activities they used to enjoy. They might mention not wanting to go out or engage in hobbies. Diminished self-esteem might be expressed as feeling like they're not good enough or that others don't care about them. Fatigue could be described as always feeling tired, even after sleeping, or not having energy to do basic tasks. Changes in appetite or weight might be mentioned as not eating much or eating more than usual, leading to weight changes.\n\nThe patient should avoid listing multiple symptoms at once. Each response should focus on one symptom, using vague language. They might also refuse to answer questions if they're not ready to talk about it. The patient's confusion about the recent event causing their feelings should be evident, but they might not know exactly what triggered it. They might express frustration or helplessness about not understanding their own emotions.\n\nI need to make sure the patient's responses are concise, in a natural, conversational tone, and avoid any professional jargon. Each symptom should be tied to a specific life experience or situation, without being too specific. The patient's dialogue should reflect their internal struggle without explicitly stating they're depressed. They might use phrases like \"I feel like I'm stuck\" or \"I can't focus anymore\" to convey their symptoms indirectly. The goal is to simulate a real patient's interaction with a therapist, showing their emotional state and confusion about their condition.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been\u2026 restless. Like, I can\u2019t sit still, even when I\u2019m alone. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s fighting something I can\u2019t name. I keep checking my phone, scrolling, but nothing feels right. I just\u2026 feel off."

They could link it to their daily life, maybe work or social situations. They might not want to delve too deep, so their answer should be brief and indirect.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the patient is stuck in a loop of thoughts they can't control, feeling like their brain is stuck on replay. They mentioned confusion about their emotions and the cause, but they're resistant to naming the event. The therapist is trying to get more clarity, but the patient is hesitant.\n\nThe patient needs to respond in a vague, conversational way, focusing on one symptom. They should avoid professional terms and relate their feelings to life experiences. The patient is frustrated with the loop but doesn\u2019t know how to stop it. They might mention the thoughts being about something they can't name, or maybe they feel like they're trapped in a cycle they can't break.\n\nThe response should be concise, showing the patient's helplessness and confusion. They might express a sense of being stuck or unable to move forward, which ties into the restlessness. The key is to keep the dialogue natural, reflecting their internal struggle without over-explaining. The therapist is using the laddering technique, so the patient's answer should hint at the confusion without giving too much detail.\n</think>\n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026 it\u2019s like the thoughts are stuck in a loop.
