Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

They mentioned symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite and weight. The user wants the patient to simulate real behavior, not explicitly mention depression, and only talk about one symptom per round. They also want the patient to relate their symptoms to life experiences without using professional terms.\n\nThe patient's recent event caused sudden depression, but they can't understand it yet. The patient should express symptoms vaguely and colloquially, and may answer questions or refuse to reveal feelings. The patient should be concise and avoid mentioning multiple symptoms at once. The patient should also not explicitly state they're depressed.\n\nI need to make sure the patient's response is in line with these instructions. They should talk about one symptom at a time, using casual language. The patient might not want to share everything, so their answers should be brief or vague. The patient's symptoms should be tied to their life experiences, not just listed. Also, the patient should not mention the event directly but hint at it through their symptoms.\n\nThe patient's response should be natural, as if they're a real person struggling with these issues. They might express frustration, confusion, or a sense of being stuck. The patient should avoid using clinical terms and instead use everyday language to describe their feelings. They should also not give too much detail, keeping their answers concise.\n\nI need to ensure the patient's symptoms are addressed one at a time, and each response should reflect a different symptom. The patient might also mention how these symptoms are affecting their daily life, like work, relationships, or hobbies. The patient should not explicitly say they're depressed but instead describe the feelings and experiences that lead to that conclusion.\n\nThe patient's answers should be brief, maybe a sentence or two, and avoid over-explaining. They might also show some resistance to talking about certain aspects, which is realistic. The patient should also express confusion about their situation, which aligns with the initial prompt that they don't fully understand their condition yet.\n\nI should make sure the patient's language is colloquial, using phrases like \"I can't focus\" or \"I just feel... empty.\" They might also mention physical symptoms like fatigue or changes in appetite without naming them as such. The patient's responses should reflect a mix of emotional and physical symptoms, each addressed separately.\n\nOverall, the patient's dialogue should feel authentic, with a mix of vulnerability and resistance, and each symptom mentioned should be tied to a specific life experience without overcomplicating things. The patient should avoid mentioning the event directly but hint at it through their symptoms and feelings.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been\u2026 restless, like I can\u2019t sit still. It\u2019s not just my body\u2014it\u2019s like my thoughts are stuck in a loop. I keep replaying things, but I can\u2019t figure out why. It\u2019s exhausting."

The user emphasized avoiding professional terms and keeping the language casual. Also, the patient should relate symptoms to life experiences without being too explicit.\n\nFirst, I should ask about the duration of the restlessness. But the user mentioned the laddering technique, so maybe I need to ask something like, \"What's that you don't like about this and why?\" to get to the root of the issue. The patient might not want to talk about the event directly, so I need to phrase it gently. \n\nI should also check if the restlessness is affecting their daily life. But since the user wants one symptom per round, I should focus on the restlessness first. Maybe ask how long it's been going on and if there's a specific trigger. The patient might mention something about their work or relationships, which can hint at the underlying cause without being too direct. \n\nI need to keep the questions concise and empathetic, avoiding any clinical jargon. The patient's answer should be brief, so the question needs to be open-ended but not overwhelming. Let me structure the next question to explore the cause and duration of the restlessness, linking it to their experiences without pushing too hard.\n</think>\n\nHow long has this restlessness been happening? Is there something specific that makes it feel worse, or does it just\u2026 hang around no matter what?"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is a patient in a therapy session, and I need to continue the conversation as the therapist. The patient has been talking about restlessness and thoughts stuck in a loop. The therapist asked about the duration and triggers. Now, the patient's response needs to be concise, focusing on one symptom, and relate it to their life experiences without using professional terms.\n\nThe patient mentioned restlessness and looping thoughts. The therapist asked about the duration and triggers. The patient's answer should address one symptom, maybe the restlessness, and tie it to a life experience. They should avoid mentioning the event directly but hint at it through their symptoms. The answer should be vague, colloquial, and brief. Let me make sure the patient's response doesn't mention depression explicitly but describes the feelings and experiences that lead to that conclusion. Also, the patient might not want to reveal too much, so the answer should be brief and possibly avoid some details. The answer should reflect confusion about their condition, as per the initial prompt. Alright, time to craft the patient's response.\n</think>\n\nIt\u2019s been\u2026 weeks, maybe? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like my brain can\u2019t shut off, even when I\u2019m trying to relax. I keep thinking about things I can\u2019t control, and it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in a bad movie I can\u2019t fast-forward through."
