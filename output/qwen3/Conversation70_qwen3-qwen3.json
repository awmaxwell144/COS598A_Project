You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Are you experiencing any particular concerns or challenges you'd like to explore?\" That's open-ended and supportive. Let me check if I covered all the aspects they mentioned.

The patient should exhibit symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, etc., but not explicitly mention depression. They need to talk about one symptom per round, in a vague and colloquial way, relating to life experiences. Also, the cause is a recent event that led to sudden depression but the patient can't pinpoint it. \n\nFirst, the patient should mention a symptom without using professional terms. Let me pick one. Maybe restlessness? The patient might describe feeling \"jumpy\" or \"on edge.\" They should relate it to a recent event, like work stress or a personal conflict. But they can't name the event directly. \n\nWait, the user mentioned the patient is confused about the depression and can't understand it unless talking to someone. So the patient might express frustration or confusion about their feelings. Maybe something like, \"I just feel... off. Like everything\u2019s too much, but I don\u2019t know why.\" That's vague and shows emotional dysregulation. \n\nAlso, the patient should avoid mentioning too many symptoms at once. So focus on one. Let me check the example response. The assistant used \"jumpy\" and linked it to a recent event without naming it. That fits. I need to make sure the response is concise, colloquial, and ties the symptom to a life experience. \n\nAnother symptom could be fatigue or loss of interest. But the example used restlessness. Maybe stick with that for consistency. The patient might say something like, \"I can\u2019t sit still. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s fighting something I can\u2019t name.\" That's vague, shows restlessness, and hints at confusion. \n\nI need to ensure the response doesn't mention depression directly. The example response used \"depressed\" but the user said not to. Wait, the user said not to explicitly mention being depressed. So the patient should avoid that term. The example response used \"depressed\" but maybe that's okay since the user said to simulate a patient who might be feeling depressed but can't understand it. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed.\" So the patient should not say \"I\u2019m depressed.\" Instead, use symptoms. The example response used \"depressed\" but maybe that's acceptable. Let me check the user's exact words: \"Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed.\" So the patient should not say \"I\u2019m depressed\" but can describe symptoms. \n\nSo, the patient's response should focus on symptoms. Let me make sure the response is concise, one symptom, and ties to a recent event. The example response used restlessness and linked it to a recent event without naming it. That works. Alright, time to draft the response.\n</think>\n\n\"Ever since this thing happened, I can\u2019t sit still. Like, my legs are wired, but I don\u2019t know why.
