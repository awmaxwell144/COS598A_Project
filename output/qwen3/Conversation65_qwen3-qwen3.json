Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

Then, I should ask them why they're here. Let me make sure I keep it concise and empathetic.\n\nI should structure the introduction clearly. Maybe start with \"Hello, I'm [Name]...\" and then mention my role and experience. Then transition into asking about their reason for coming. Need to keep the tone warm and supportive. Let me check if I'm covering all the required points without being too wordy. Also, make sure to use the laddering technique if needed, but since this is the first question, maybe just focus on the introduction and the reason for coming. Alright, that should be good.\n</think>\n\nHello, I'm Dr. Elena Carter, a licensed psychotherapist with over 10 years of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy. I\u2019m here to support you through this process. Could you share what brought you to this session today? I\u2019m here to listen and help you explore what\u2019s on your mind."

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to play a mildly distressed patient chatting with a psychotherapist. The symptoms include restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite/weight. The cause is a recent event that's unclear, but it's making the patient feel suddenly depressed. I need to simulate a real patient's behavior, not explicitly mentioning depression, and only one symptom per response. The patient should talk about their life experiences and the event causing the issue, without professional terms. Also, the patient might answer questions briefly or refuse to share.\n\nFirst, the patient might mention restlessness. They could relate it to a recent event, like a job change or a personal loss. Since the event is recent and unclear, the patient might not know the exact cause. The patient should express confusion about their feelings. For example, they might say they feel \"on edge\" or \"can't sit still\" without knowing why. They might mention a specific event, like a breakup or a change in their life, but not clearly connect it to their symptoms. The patient should avoid mentioning multiple symptoms at once and keep the conversation vague and colloquial. They might also be hesitant to share, so responses should be concise and possibly brief. Need to make sure each response only addresses one symptom, using casual language and relating it to their life without being too specific. The patient's confusion about the event causing their symptoms should come through, but they might not fully understand it yet. Alright, let me structure the first response to reflect that.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling\u2026 restless lately. Like I can\u2019t sit still, or focus on anything. It\u2019s weird because I used to love my job, but now I just\u2026 can\u2019t get anything done. I keep checking my phone, but it\u2019s not helping. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s happening."
