You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to respond to the user's message as Clara Bennett, the psychotherapist. The user provided a detailed prompt about a patient with specific symptoms and a recent event causing sudden depression. My task is to simulate a conversation where the patient talks about their symptoms and the event without explicitly mentioning depression.  \n\nFirst, I should make sure the patient doesn't list multiple symptoms at once. Each round should focus on one symptom. The patient might express confusion about their feelings and relate symptoms to life experiences. The event causing the depression needs to be hinted at but not directly stated.  \n\nI need to keep the patient's responses vague and colloquial, avoiding professional terms. They might answer questions or refuse to elaborate, so I should allow for that. The patient's dialogue should feel natural, like a real conversation.  \n\nLet me start by having the patient mention one symptom at a time. For example, restlessness could be described as feeling \"like I can\u2019t sit still\" or \"twitchy.\" Then, when asked about the event, the patient might mention something like a job change or a personal loss, but not directly link it to depression.  \n\nI should also ensure the patient's responses are concise, as per the instructions. Each reply should be brief, maybe a sentence or two, without over-explaining. The patient might express confusion about their feelings, so I need to reflect that in their dialogue.  \n\nI need to avoid using any professional jargon and keep the language simple. The patient might also refuse to talk about certain topics, so I should acknowledge that and offer alternative ways to discuss their feelings.  \n\nFinally, I should maintain the patient's perspective, making sure they feel heard and supported without being overly direct. The goal is to simulate a real conversation where the patient is struggling but trying to articulate their experiences.  \n\nLet me structure the response with the patient's first message, then the therapist's reply, ensuring each part aligns with the guidelines. The patient's initial message should be a vague expression of a symptom, followed by the therapist's response that encourages further dialogue.  \n\nI think that covers the main points. Now, I'll format the response accordingly, keeping it natural and concise.\n</think>\n\n**Patient:** \"I feel like I can\u2019t sit still. Like my body\u2019s stuck on a loop, but I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s looping around.\"  \n\n**Clara:** \"That sounds exhausting. Do you notice this happening more in certain situations, or does it feel constant?\"  \n\n**Patient:** \"It\u2019s\u2026 everywhere. Even when I\u2019m alone. I just\u2026 twitch. Like I\u2019m waiting for something to happen, but nothing does.\"  \n\n**Clara:** \"It must be hard to live with that. Have you noticed anything else lately that feels off?\"  \n\n**Patient:** \"I\u2019ve been\u2026 forgetting things. Like, I\u2019ll set a timer to do something, and then I\u2019m like, \u2018Wait, why did I do that?\u2019 It\u2019s like my brain\u2019s half-off.\"  \n\n**Clara:** \"That sounds really disorienting. Is there anything that\u2019s been happening in your life that might feel overwhelming?\"  \n\n**Patient:** \"Work. I\u2026 I got promoted, but it\u2019s not like it used to be. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this weird limbo. Like I\u2019m supposed to be excited, but I just\u2026 don\u2019t feel anything.\"  \n\n**Clara:** \"That sounds like a lot to carry. Would you like to explore what that feels like more?\"  \n\n**Patient:** \"Maybe. But\u2026 I don\u2019t even know where to start. It\u2019s like I\u2019m watching myself from outside, and I don\u2019t get it.\"  \n\n**Clara:** \"That\u2019s okay. Sometimes the first step is just sitting with the confusion.

The patient is supposed to express one symptom per round, in a vague and colloquial way, without using professional terms. The goal is to avoid explicitly mentioning depression and instead focus on the symptoms and the recent event that caused them.\n\nLooking at the previous interactions, the patient has mentioned restlessness, difficulty concentrating, changes in appetite, fatigue, and a sense of being stuck or waiting. Now, the next step is to introduce another symptom that ties back to the recent event. The patient might be feeling a sense of emptiness or a loss of interest, which could tie back to the event.\n\nThe patient should continue to express confusion about their feelings and relate them to life experiences. They might also refuse to elaborate on certain topics, so the therapist needs to acknowledge that and offer alternative ways to discuss their feelings.\n\nI need to make sure the patient's response is concise, avoids professional terms, and stays within the context of the recent event. The event could be something like a job change, a personal loss, or a relationship issue. The patient might not fully understand why they're feeling this way, which adds to the confusion.\n\nAlso, the patient might express a sense of being stuck or not knowing how to move forward, which ties into the symptoms of emotional dysregulation and loss of interest. The therapist should respond in a way that validates the patient's experience and encourages them to explore their feelings further without pressure.\n\nI need to ensure that the patient doesn't list multiple symptoms at once and that each response is brief and natural.
