Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

The user also wants to cover emotion, sleep, weight, appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. But I need to ask one question at a time. \n\nHmm, the user said to use empathetic strategies and be concise. So the introduction should be friendly and professional. Let me structure it: name, surname, job, experience. Then ask why they came. Need to make sure it's clear and not too long. Also, check if the user is comfortable with the approach.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want me to simulate a psychotherapist using CBT techniques. The user provided a detailed scenario where the patient is experiencing various symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, etc., caused by a recent event. The patient is confused and needs to talk through their feelings without explicitly mentioning depression.\n\nFirst, I need to create a natural dialogue. The user mentioned that the patient should express symptoms in a vague, colloquial way, one at a time. The therapist should ask open-ended questions, use empathy, and avoid professional jargon. Also, the patient shouldn't mention too many symptoms at once. \n\nI should start by introducing myself as the therapist, then ask the patient how they're feeling. The patient's response should reflect confusion and a mix of symptoms. For example, they might mention feeling restless or losing interest in things. The therapist needs to probe gently, asking about specific situations or triggers. \n\nI need to ensure that the patient doesn't explicitly state they're depressed. Instead, they should describe their feelings in a more general way. The therapist should encourage the patient to explore their experiences without judgment. Also, the patient might avoid answering some questions, so the therapist should respect that and not push too hard. \n\nI should also remember that the patient is trying to understand the cause of their symptoms, which is a recent event. The therapist needs to guide the patient to reflect on their life events without leading them. Each response should be concise, as per the user's instruction. \n\nNow, structuring the first response: the therapist introduces themselves, then asks how the patient is feeling. The patient responds with a vague symptom, like feeling restless. The therapist then asks about specific situations where this happens. This sets up the conversation to explore the patient's experiences and underlying issues without being too direct. \n\nI need to make sure the dialogue flows naturally, with the therapist being supportive and the patient expressing their feelings in a way that's relatable. Avoiding technical terms and keeping the language simple and conversational is key. Also, the patient's answers should be brief, reflecting their confusion and the need to process their emotions. \n\nFinally, the therapist should encourage the patient to continue sharing at their own pace, ensuring they feel safe and understood. This approach should help the patient gradually uncover the cause of their symptoms while maintaining a therapeutic environment.\n</think>\n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \n*(Leaning forward slightly, voice warm but attentive)*  \nI\u2019m here to listen.

Have you ever felt that before, or was it new?  \n\n**Patient:**  \n*(Looking away)*  \nNo\u2026 it\u2019s not like before. It\u2019s\u2026 worse.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \n*(Gently)*  \nWorse. That\u2019s a lot to carry. Can you tell me what\u2019s been happening in your life lately?  \n\n**Patient:**  \n*(Voice trembling slightly)*  \nNothing\u2026 nothing *should* be happening. But it\u2019s like\u2026 everything\u2019s just\u2026 *empty*.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \n*(Nodding slowly)*  \nEmpty. That\u2019s a hard word to describe. Are there things you used to look forward to that feel different now?  \n\n**Patient:**  \n*(Frowning)*  \nMy favorite show\u2026 I used to binge it every week. Now I can\u2019t even remember the last time I watched an episode.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \n*(Softly)*  \nThat\u2019s a big change. It\u2019s okay to feel lost sometimes.

Is there anything else that feels different in your body or mind?  \n\n**Patient:**  \n*(Sighs deeply)*  \nMy chest\u2026 it feels tight. Like I can\u2019t breathe properly.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \n*(Gently)*  \nThat\u2019s a lot to carry. It\u2019s okay to feel that way. Can you tell me what\u2019s been happening in your life lately?  \n\n**Patient:**  \n*(Voice breaking)*  \nI\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Nothing. Everything just\u2026 *hurts*.  \n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez:**  \n*(Softly)*  \nYou\u2019re not alone in feeling that way. I\u2019m here to help you make sense of it. Let\u2019s take it one step at a time."
