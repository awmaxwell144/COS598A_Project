Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to simulate a patient's response to a therapist. Let me make sure I follow the guidelines. The patient should mention one symptom per round, in a vague and colloquial way, without using professional terms. They should also not explicitly mention being depressed.\n\nHmm, the patient mentioned feeling \"empty\" and \"like I'm just going through the motions.\" That's a good start. Now, the next step is to have the patient talk about another symptom. Let me pick one that's common but not too obvious. Maybe something related to sleep or energy? \n\nWait, the user said to avoid mentioning too many symptoms at once. So each response should focus on one symptom. Let me think of a symptom that's relatable but not too specific. Maybe something about losing interest in things they used to enjoy. That's a common symptom of depression but phrased in a vague way. \n\nAlso, the patient should relate it to their life experiences. Maybe they mention not wanting to do things they used to love. That ties into loss of interest. Let me make sure the language is casual, not clinical. Avoid words like \"depression\" or \"symptoms.\" Instead, use phrases like \"feeling like I don\u2019t care anymore\" or \"not wanting to do the things I used to.\"\n\nI need to check if the patient is connecting the symptom to a recent event. The user mentioned the condition is caused by a recent event, but the patient doesn't know what it is. So the patient's responses should hint at that without being explicit. Maybe they mention something like \"things just feel... different lately\" or \"like I\u2019m stuck in this fog.\"\n\nAlso, the patient might answer questions or refuse to talk about it. So I should allow for that. Maybe the patient says they don't know how to explain it. But the user's example had the patient talk about feeling empty and then not wanting to do things they used to enjoy. Let me stick to that structure but keep it concise.\n\nWait, the user wants the patient to talk about the symptoms in a vague way, relating to life experiences. So the response should be something like, \"I don\u2019t feel like doing the things I used to love. It\u2019s like... I don\u2019t care anymore.\" That's a good way to express loss of interest without using clinical terms.\n\nI need to make sure the patient doesn't mention too many symptoms at once. Each response should focus on one. So in the next round, if the therapist asks a follow-up, the patient might mention another symptom like fatigue or difficulty concentrating. But for now, the first response is about loss of interest. Let me confirm that this fits the guidelines and is natural-sounding.\n</think>\n\n**Patient:**  \nI don\u2019t feel like doing the things I used to love. It\u2019s like... I don\u2019t care anymore.
