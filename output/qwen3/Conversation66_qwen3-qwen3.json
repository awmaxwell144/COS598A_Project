Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

Then ask why they're here. But I need to make sure the introduction is friendly and supportive. Let me check if I'm following all the guidelines. The user wants an empathetic approach, so the introduction should be warm and inviting. I should avoid being too formal. Maybe add a sentence about being here to help. Then transition into asking why they're here. That should cover the initial step. Now, I need to make sure the next questions cover the required aspects. Let me structure the questions to go through each area, starting with the reason for coming, then moving into emotions, sleep, etc. Each question should be specific and open-ended to encourage detailed answers. Also, using laddering by asking about the duration, causes, and specific manifestations. I need to keep each response concise and focused. Let me make sure the first question is the introduction and the second is asking why they're here. That should set the stage for the rest of the assessment.
