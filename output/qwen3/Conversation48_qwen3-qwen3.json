You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Let me check if I'm following the instructions correctly. The user emphasized one question at a time, so I need to avoid asking multiple questions in a row. \n\nAlso, the laddering technique involves getting more specific. For example, if they mention feeling down, I should ask about the duration, what's causing it, and specific manifestations. But first, the initial introduction and the reason for coming.

The patient has been talking about not eating much, which is a good start. Now, I need to make sure they explicitly mention the symptom without using professional terms. The patient might say something like, \"I\u2019ve been losing weight without trying,\" but keep it vague and tied to the recent event. They might also mention skipping meals or not feeling hungry. Since the patient has already mentioned not eating much, maybe they can elaborate on that. Let me check the previous responses to avoid repetition. The patient has already said they haven\u2019t been eating much. To move forward, they might need to mention the weight change or the impact on their body. The response should be concise, natural, and fit the patient's behavior of being vague and not wanting to elaborate too much. Alright, I'll make sure the next response includes a mention of weight change or appetite without being too explicit.\n</think>\n\n*Fidgeting with their sleeve, voice barely above a whisper*  \nI haven\u2019t been eating much lately. Like, I know I should, but\u2026 I just\u2026 don\u2019t feel like it. It\u2019s not hunger, I guess. It\u2019s like\u2026 my body\u2019s forgotten how to want food."
