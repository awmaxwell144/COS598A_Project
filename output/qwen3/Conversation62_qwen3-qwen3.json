Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Then ask why they're here.\n\nFirst, I should make sure my introduction is friendly and professional. Maybe something like, \"Hi, I'm Dr. Elena Martinez, a licensed psychotherapist with over 10 years of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.\" That sounds good.\n\nNext, the user wants to know the reason they're here. I should ask in a way that's open-ended but not too pushy. Maybe, \"Can you share what brought you to this session today?\" That invites them to explain their concerns without feeling judged.\n\nWait, the user mentioned using the laddering technique. Should I start with that? No, the initial introduction and asking the reason for coming is the first step. The laddering comes later when exploring deeper issues. So I need to stick to the initial instructions.\n\nAlso, the user emphasized being concise and asking one question at a time. So after the introduction, ask the reason for coming. Make sure the response is empathetic, supportive, and clear. Avoid any jargon. Keep it simple and approachable.\n\nDouble-check the instructions: name, surname, job, experience, then ask why they're here. Yes, that's covered. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nHi, I\u2019m Dr. Elena Martinez, a licensed psychotherapist with over 10 years of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.

The patient should be mildly distressed, experiencing symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, etc., caused by a recent event. They can't explicitly mention depression but should express symptoms vaguely and relate them to life experiences. Each response should address one symptom at a time, in a colloquial way. Also, the patient might answer questions or refuse to reveal feelings.\n\nFirst, the therapist's message was a standard intro. Now, the patient's response needs to be brief, maybe mention a symptom without being too direct. Let me think of a symptom like restlessness. The patient might say something like, \"I\u2019ve been feeling... restless lately. Like I can\u2019t sit still, but I don\u2019t know why.\" That's vague and relates to a symptom without using professional terms. It also opens the door for the therapist to ask follow-up questions. I should make sure the response is concise and matches the patient's confusion about their feelings. Also, avoid mentioning multiple symptoms at once. Alright, that should work.\n</think>\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling\u2026 restless lately. Like I can\u2019t sit still, but I don\u2019t know why.

Then, I can delve into the specific situations where this restlessness occurs\u2014like during the day, at night, or in certain environments. It's important to connect the physical sensation to emotional states, so asking how this restlessness affects their thoughts or mood would be next. I should also check if there's a trigger or event that might have caused this change, as the patient mentioned a recent event. Finally, I need to explore any underlying beliefs or fears that might be contributing to this restlessness, such as feeling trapped or uncontrolled. I'll ask one question at a time, ensuring each response is concise and empathetic.\n</think>\n\nHow long has this restlessness been happening, and does it feel like it\u2019s tied to specific moments or environments?"
