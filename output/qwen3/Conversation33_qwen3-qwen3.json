Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to introduce myself as a psychotherapist using the CBT approach. First, I need to make sure I cover all the required aspects: emotion, sleep, weight/appetite, loss of interest, energy, and social function. But the user also wants me to ask one question at a time, so I have to structure the conversation carefully.\n\nStarting with the introduction, I should mention my name, surname, job, and experience. Then, ask why they're here. The user might be feeling anxious or unsure, so I need to be empathetic and encouraging. \n\nNext, I need to ask about their current emotional state. Maybe start with how they're feeling lately. That's a good entry point. Then, move to sleep patterns, since that's often linked to mood. After that, check in on appetite and weight changes, which can indicate underlying issues. \n\nLoss of interest is another key area. I should ask about activities they used to enjoy. Energy levels and social function are important too, so asking about their energy and how they're interacting with others would be good. \n\nUsing the laddering technique, I need to dig deeper. For example, if they mention feeling sad, I can ask what specifically is making them feel that way. This helps uncover underlying beliefs or triggers. \n\nI should also use empathetic strategies throughout, like acknowledging their feelings and offering support. Keeping the questions concise but thorough is crucial. Let me make sure each question flows naturally and covers all the required aspects without overwhelming the user. \n\nWait, the user mentioned to collect all information by the end, so I need to ensure that each question is part of a structured process. Maybe start with emotions, then sleep, then appetite, then interest, energy, and social function. That way, all the required aspects are covered. \n\nI should also check for the duration and specific manifestations of symptoms. For example, asking how long they've felt this way or what specific situations trigger their emotions. This helps in understanding the root cause. \n\nLet me outline the steps again to make sure I don't miss anything. Introduction, then each aspect one by one, using empathetic language and laddering questions. That should cover everything the user requested.\n</think>\n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez, licensed psychotherapist with 10 years of experience specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy.**  \nThank you for reaching out. I\u2019m here to support you, no matter what\u2019s bringing you here. Can you share what\u2019s been on your mind lately? What brought you to this moment?"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to simulate a patient's conversation with a therapist, focusing on specific symptoms without mentioning depression explicitly. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the patient should exhibit symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, low self-esteem, fatigue, and changes in appetite/weight. These symptoms need to be mentioned one at a time, in a vague, colloquial way. The patient should be confused about their feelings, not clearly understanding why they're feeling this way, but it's linked to a recent event. The event isn't specified, so I need to keep it ambiguous. \n\nThe patient should also be concise, not revealing too much at once. They might answer questions or refuse to talk about certain things. The therapist's role is to guide the conversation, asking questions that uncover the underlying issues without being too direct. \n\nI need to make sure each response from the patient is a single symptom, related to their life experiences, and not using professional terms. The patient's answers should be vague, like \"I can't sit still\" or \"I feel like everything's heavier.\" \n\nAlso, the patient should be confused about their feelings, so their responses might include uncertainty or frustration. The therapist should respond with empathy, encouraging the patient to explore their feelings without judgment. \n\nI should structure the conversation so that each round focuses on one symptom, allowing the patient to express their experience without overloading the dialogue. The therapist's questions need to be open-ended, prompting the patient to elaborate on their symptoms and their impact on daily life. \n\nI need to avoid mentioning depression explicitly, instead using terms like \"feeling stuck\" or \"not being able to focus.\" The patient's answers should reflect their confusion and the recent event's effect, without naming the event. \n\nLet me start by having the patient mention one symptom, then the therapist asks a follow-up question to explore it further. This way, the conversation unfolds naturally, with each exchange revealing more about the patient's state without being too direct. \n\nI should also ensure that the patient's responses are concise, as per the user's instructions, and that the therapist's questions are designed to uncover the underlying issues without pushing too hard. The goal is to simulate a real patient-therapist interaction, with the patient being honest but hesitant, and the therapist guiding them gently. \n\nBy following this structure, I can create a realistic dialogue that meets all the specified criteria, allowing the patient to express their symptoms in a way that's both authentic and aligned with the user's requirements.\n</think>\n\n**Patient:** I can\u2019t sit still anymore. Like, even when I\u2019m supposed to be calm, my legs just\u2026 twitch. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s fighting something I can\u2019t name.  \n\n**Therapist:** That sounds exhausting. Does it feel like it\u2019s affecting your work or daily routines?  \n\n**Patient:** Sometimes. I\u2019ll be in the middle of a task, and suddenly I\u2019m pacing the room, thinking about\u2026 stuff. But I don\u2019t even know what the stuff is. It\u2019s like my brain\u2019s stuck in a loop.  \n\n**Therapist:** It sounds like your mind is working overtime, but you\u2019re not sure what it\u2019s trying to fix. Have you noticed anything else lately?  \n\n**Patient:** I\u2019ve been eating way more than usual. Like, I\u2019ll grab snacks all the time, but I don\u2019t feel satisfied. It\u2019s weird. I\u2019m not hungry, but I can\u2019t stop.  \n\n**Therapist:** That\u2019s a lot to process. Does it feel like your body or mind is reacting to something you\u2019re avoiding?  \n\n**Patient:** Maybe. I\u2019ve been avoiding people, too. Like, I don\u2019t want to talk to friends or family. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re doing anything\u2014just\u2026 everything feels too much.  \n\n**Therapist:** It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a lot of weight, both literally and emotionally. Have you noticed any changes in how you feel about yourself lately?  \n\n**Patient:** I don\u2019t know. I feel\u2026 empty. Like I\u2019m not even sure who I am anymore. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m angry or sad\u2014it\u2019s just\u2026 everything feels too heavy.  \n\n**Therapist:** That\u2019s a lot to carry. Is there anything specific that\u2019s been happening in your life recently that feels connected to how you\u2019re feeling?  \n\n**Patient:** \u2026I don\u2019t know. I just feel like I\u2019m stuck in this fog. I can\u2019t think straight, and I don\u2019t know how to get out.  \n\n**Therapist:** I hear you. It sounds like you\u2019re trying to make sense of something that feels too big to handle. Would you be open to exploring what might be causing this fog?  \n\n**Patient:** \u2026Maybe. But I don\u2019t even know where to start."

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user has provided a long conversation between a therapist and a patient where the patient keeps saying they feel stuck and the therapist keeps asking them to name a small step. The user might be looking for a way to help the patient move forward, or maybe they want to understand the therapeutic approach here. Let me think about how to respond.\n\nFirst, the therapist's approach is to encourage the patient to identify a small, manageable action. That's a common technique in CBT to break down overwhelming situations. But the patient isn't responding, which could indicate resistance, overwhelm, or maybe they don't see the steps as relevant. The therapist might need to explore why the patient feels stuck\u2014maybe there are deeper issues or unmet needs.\n\nI should consider possible strategies. Maybe the therapist could ask the patient to reflect on what's holding them back, or explore their feelings about the situation. Alternatively, the therapist might need to validate the patient's feelings before moving forward. It's also possible the patient is experiencing a crisis or has a mental health condition that's making it hard to engage.\n\nI should also check if the user is role-playing, testing the AI's response, or seeking advice on how to handle such a scenario. Since the user hasn't provided a question, I need to ask for clarification. Maybe they want to know how to handle a patient who's unresponsive, or they're looking for a script for the therapist to use. Alternatively, they might be interested in the psychological reasons behind the patient's behavior.\n\nI should respond by acknowledging the situation and asking the user to clarify their intent. That way, I can provide a helpful and targeted response without making assumptions.\n</think>\n\nIt seems like the patient is struggling to move forward with identifying a small step, which might indicate resistance, overwhelm, or a deeper emotional block. Here\u2019s how the therapist could adapt their approach:\n\n1. **Validate the Patient\u2019s Feelings**:  \n   *Therapist*: \"It sounds like this situation feels really overwhelming. It\u2019s okay to feel stuck\u2014sometimes the first step is just acknowledging how difficult it can be.\"  \n   This helps the patient feel heard and reduces pressure to \"solve\" the problem immediately.\n\n2. **Explore the Root of the Stuckness**:  \n   *Therapist*: \"Can you tell me more about what\u2019s making this feel so stuck? Is there a fear or worry that\u2019s holding you back?\"  \n   This invites the patient to reflect on underlying emotions or beliefs (e.g., fear of failure, perfectionism) that might be contributing to the block.\n\n3. **Reframe the Step as a \"Check-In\"**:  \n   *Therapist*: \"What if we start by checking in with yourself? Just asking, *\u2018What\u2019s one thing I can notice right now without judgment?\u2019* That might be a tiny step to begin with.\"  \n   This shifts the focus from action to self-awareness, which can feel less intimidating.\n\n4. **Normalize the Process**:  \n   *Therapist*: \"Sometimes, even small steps feel impossible when we\u2019re in the middle of a storm. It\u2019s part of the process to feel stuck, and that\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s take this one moment at a time.\"  \n   This reduces shame and emphasizes that progress isn\u2019t linear.\n\n5. **Offer Alternatives**:  \n   *Therapist*: \"If you\u2019re not ready to take a step, what would feel more manageable? Even a minute of breathing or a simple observation could be a start.\"  \n   This gives the patient autonomy to choose a less demanding action.\n\n**Why This Works**:  \nThe therapist is balancing empathy with gentle guidance, avoiding pressure while creating space for the patient to reconnect with their capacity for agency. If the patient remains unresponsive, the therapist might later explore systemic factors (e.g., trauma, mental health challenges) that could be contributing to the block.\n\nWould you like to clarify your intent (e.g., role-playing, seeking advice, or exploring therapeutic strategies)? This will help tailor the response!"
