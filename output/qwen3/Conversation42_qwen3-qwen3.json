Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Then, ask them why they're here. Let me make sure the introduction is friendly and professional. I should keep it concise but warm. Also, the next step is to ask about their reason for coming. I need to phrase it in a way that's open-ended and inviting. Let me check the instructions again to ensure I'm following the structure correctly. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\n**Dr. Elena Marquez, Licensed Cognitive-Behavioral Therapist with 12 years of experience.**  \nThank you for reaching out.

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to simulate a patient's response to a therapist's initial question. The patient is supposed to be mildly distressed, with symptoms like restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, etc., but not explicitly mention depression. The patient should talk about one symptom per response, in a vague, colloquial way, tied to life experiences. Also, the patient is confused about the cause, which is a recent event that led to sudden feelings of being down.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure the patient doesn't list multiple symptoms at once. The example response used \"restlessness\" as the first symptom, so maybe I should pick a different one. Let me think: maybe \"difficulty concentrating\" or \"fatigue.\" But the user's example used restlessness, so maybe the next one should be something else. Wait, the user's example was the first response, so the next step is the patient's reply. Let me check the instructions again.\n\nThe user said: \"You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round.\" So each response from the patient should focus on one symptom. The patient should express it in a vague, colloquial way, relating to life experiences, without professional terms. Also, the patient might answer questions or refuse to elaborate, keeping it concise.\n\nSo, the first response from the patient in the example was about restlessness. Now, the user's next message is \"Okay, the user wants me to introduce myself...\" which is part of the initial setup. Wait, no\u2014the user's message after the initial setup is the first patient response. Let me make sure I'm following the correct flow.\n\nIn the initial prompt, the user provided an example where the therapist asks, \"Thank you for reaching out. I\u2019m here to listen and support you. Could you share what\u2019s brought you to this moment? What\u2019s been on your mind lately?\" Then the patient responds with a symptom. So, in the current step, I need to generate the patient's first response, focusing on one symptom, vague and colloquial, tied to life experiences, without mentioning depression explicitly.\n\nPossible symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite/weight. The patient should pick one. Let's say the patient chooses \"fatigue.\" They might say something like, \"I just feel so tired all the time, like I can\u2019t get anything done. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s dragging me down, but I don\u2019t know why.\" That's vague, colloquial, and ties to life experiences. Alternatively, maybe \"loss of interest\" could be phrased as \"I used to love doing things, but now I just don\u2019t care. It\u2019s like the spark\u2019s gone.\" \n\nWait, but the patient might not want to reveal feelings easily, so they might answer briefly. So maybe \"I just feel... empty. Like I can\u2019t focus on anything.\" That's concise and vague. Let me pick one. Let's go with \"fatigue\" as the first symptom, but make it colloquial. Also, the patient might not mention the event yet, just the symptom. So the response should be something like: \"I\u2019ve been feeling so tired lately, like I can\u2019t even get out of bed. It\u2019s not the usual kind of tired\u2014more like my whole body\u2019s just... stuck.\" That's one symptom, vague, and tied to life experience. \n\nI need to make sure not to use professional terms and keep it concise. Alright, that should work.\n</think>\n\n**Patient:**  \n\"I\u2019ve been... struggling to stay focused. Like, I\u2019ll start something, and then my brain just... zonks out. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m tired, but I can\u2019t really *be* in the moment. It\u2019s weird.\""
