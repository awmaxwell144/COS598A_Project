Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

I\u2019ve been working in this field for over ten years, primarily focusing on helping individuals manage difficult emotions and develop coping strategies for a wide range of challenges. It\u2019s wonderful to meet you. \n\nThank you for coming in today. It takes a lot of courage to reach out, and I want to assure you that you\u2019re in a safe and supportive space. \n\nTo start, could you tell me, what\u2019s brought you here today? What\u2019s the main reason you felt the need to seek support and make this appointment?"

It's understandable to feel baffled when something like this emerges, especially if it\u2019s not typical behavior for you. \n\nLet's unpack this a little. When you say it feels \"urgent,\" can you describe *what* feels urgent? Is there a specific thought or feeling associated with that urgency? And, importantly, when did this pacing start? Was there a particular event or period that seemed to trigger it, or has it been a gradual increase?"

Let\u2019s delve into the gallery opening. You mentioned it triggered this. Can you describe the opening itself? What specifically happened that you recall feeling particularly\u2026 intense, or perhaps even a little overwhelming? And when you say \"overwhelming,\" what specifically contributed to that feeling?"

Like, aggressively serious. \n\nIt just felt\u2026 scrutinized. Like everything I\u2019d put my heart and soul into was being judged, instantly.

It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019d feel overwhelmed by that kind of intense scrutiny. Let\u2019s really hone in on that feeling of being judged. When you say \u201cjudged,\u201d what specifically about the judging makes you feel this way? Is it the potential for negative criticism? The feeling of inadequacy? Or something else entirely? Let's use the laddering technique \u2013 let\u2019s drill down to the core belief behind that feeling. What is that you don\u2019t like about being judged, and *why*?"

Can you recall a time in your life \u2013 perhaps from childhood \u2013 where you felt this way of needing external validation? Was there a specific experience or pattern that contributed to this belief? And thinking back, what messages did you receive about your value or worth during that time?"

Not outwardly cruel, but\u2026 always pointing out flaws. Every painting I made as a child, he\u2019d say, \u201cThe perspective is off,\u201d or \u201cThe colors are too vibrant.\u201d He never praised me, really. Just\u2026 corrections. Constant corrections. It built up, you know? Like a layer of sediment. I started to equate my worth with his approval. If he liked something, I felt\u2026 okay. If he didn\u2019t, I felt like a failure. It\u2019s\u2026 ingrained, I think. It\u2019s why I push so hard, why I need to succeed.

That \u2018switch\u2019 you describe, that sudden shift into a torrent of self-criticism and shame, is a really powerful image \u2013 and it\u2019s incredibly common when deeply rooted beliefs are triggered. What you're experiencing is a cascade effect, a result of repeatedly associating your self-worth with the outcome of your efforts. \n\nLet\u2019s try to interrupt that cycle, even just for a moment. When you recognize that \u2018switch\u2019 flipping, what *can* you tell yourself instead of those harsh, critical thoughts? Is there even a tiny whisper of self-compassion, or a reminder that setbacks are a normal part of the process?

Just one phrase. It doesn\u2019t have to be profound. It doesn't have to change the world. Just a small acknowledgment of your worth, regardless of the outcome.

When you say \u201cIt\u2019s okay to feel this,\u201d what *specifically* are you saying to yourself? What are you accepting in that moment? Are you accepting the disappointment? The frustration?

And self-compassion, at its core, is about treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend who was struggling. \n\nFor this week, I\u2019d like you to practice saying that phrase \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m feeling\u2026 overwhelmed.
