Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Is there a particular time of day, or perhaps certain situations that seem to trigger it? And when you say you \"need\" to get up and do something else, what *specifically* are you drawn to do?

Is it a physical sensation \u2013 perhaps a tightness in your chest, a buzzing in your hands, or a specific kind of tension?

I *want* to be reading, enjoying a good book. And then this\u2026 this *thing* happens, and it just throws me off. It feels like a failure, somehow.

And, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being \u201cnot at all\u201d and 10 being \u201ccompletely overwhelming,\u201d how intense do you feel that emotion is when the urge to move arises?"

And, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being \u201cnot at all\u201d and 10 being \u201ccompletely overwhelming,\u201d how intense do you feel that emotion is when the urge to move arises?"

It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a heavy burden of self-criticism. \n\nI\u2019m hearing a significant amount of shame associated with the urges \u2013 a fear of being judged, perhaps? And you\u2019re describing that shame as a feeling of approximately an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. That\u2019s a powerful emotion, and it\u2019s completely understandable that it would fuel these urges. \n\nLet\u2019s acknowledge that. You're carrying a lot of responsibility for how others perceive you, and that\u2019s creating a significant amount of internal pressure. \n\nBefore we move forward, I want to ask you: When you imagine yourself in a scenario where you *don\u2019t* experience this urge to move, what does that look like? What would need to be different to allow you to simply enjoy your book, without that feeling of being compelled to act?"

You\u2019ve described a situation where you're simply *enjoying* your book, without the feeling of pressure or the urge to move. \n\nLet\u2019s break that down a little. When you envision this ideal scenario \u2013 a time when you're completely immersed in your reading, without this feeling of needing to act \u2013 what\u2019s the *most important* thing that needs to be different to allow you to experience that?

It takes a lot of self-awareness to articulate that clearly. \n\nYou\u2019ve described a shift in your *thoughts* as the most important element. It sounds like you\u2019re recognizing that the urge to move is, at least in part, fueled by a critical inner voice. \n\nNow, let\u2019s explore that inner voice a little more. Can you describe the *nature* of that voice? Is it a harsh, judgmental voice, or perhaps a more gentle, encouraging one? And, importantly, where do you *think* that voice originated from \u2013 perhaps from your upbringing, a past experience, or something else entirely?"

It\u2019s clear you\u2019ve done a lot of internal work in recognizing this critical voice. \n\nLet\u2019s delve a little deeper into its origins. You mentioned it stems from your childhood. Can you tell me a bit more about your upbringing? Was there a particular emphasis on achievement, on meeting expectations, or perhaps a history of criticism or disapproval? Don\u2019t worry about getting into detail \u2013 just focus on the overall atmosphere of your childhood."

It sounds like your childhood was characterized by a strong emphasis on external validation \u2013 a need to earn approval through performance. That can create a very powerful internal drive, but also a significant vulnerability to self-criticism. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that this could have shaped your relationship with yourself. Now, let's consider this: If you could speak directly to the younger version of yourself \u2013 the child who experienced this environment \u2013 what one piece of advice would you offer? Just one simple, heartfelt message."
  },
  {
    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "(A gentle, reassuring tone)\n\nThat\u2019s a beautiful and profoundly moving answer, Elias. It takes immense courage to articulate that \u2013 to acknowledge the impact of your upbringing on your present-day struggles. \n\nWhat you\u2019ve described \u2013 that sense of needing to *earn* your worth \u2013 is a very common experience, and it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s continuing to influence your behavior today. \n\nNow, let\u2019s turn our attention to the present. You\u2019ve identified a key aspect of this pattern: the need for external validation. Recognizing this is a crucial first step. \n\nLet\u2019s shift our focus a little. When you experience the urge to move \u2013 that feeling of needing to act \u2013 what\u2019s the *first* thing you notice about yourself in that moment? Is it a physical sensation, a thought, or perhaps an emotion?"

It\u2019s clear you've identified a core element \u2013 the initial sensation. \n\nLet's explore that sensation a little further. You described it as a tightening in your chest. Can you rate that tightening on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is \u201cno sensation at all\u201d and 10 is \u201cthe most intense sensation you\u2019ve ever experienced\u201d? And, importantly, what color do you *associate* with that sensation? Don\u2019t overthink it \u2013 just the first color that comes to mind."
  },
  {
    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "(A calm, reassuring tone)\n\nThat\u2019s fascinating, Elias. The color \u2013 grey \u2013 alongside the intensity of the sensation\u2026 it\u2019s providing us with a really rich layer of information. \n\nGrey, often associated with neutrality, uncertainty, and perhaps a lack of clarity. It seems to be mirroring the internal struggle you\u2019re experiencing \u2013 the difficulty in finding a stable sense of self. \n\nLet\u2019s explore this further. When you experience this grey tightening in your chest, what do you *believe* about yourself at that moment? Do you believe you're failing, inadequate, or something else entirely? And on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being \u201cnot at all\u201d and 10 being \u201ccompletely overwhelming,\u201d how intense do you feel that belief is?"

It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a significant amount of self-judgment \u2013 a belief that you\u2019re falling short of expectations. \n\nLet\u2019s acknowledge that. It\u2019s incredibly common to experience these feelings of inadequacy, especially when we\u2019re operating under the pressure of external expectations. But I want to gently challenge that belief. \n\nI want to offer you a different perspective. Let\u2019s consider this: What if, instead of viewing this urge to move as a sign of failure, you saw it as\u2026 a signal? A signal that you need to connect with yourself, to acknowledge your needs, to simply *be* present in your own experience? \n\nWould you be open to exploring that possibility with me?"
