Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

It's completely understandable that getting out of bed feels like a huge effort when you're feeling so drained and uncertain.\n\nCan you tell me more about what a typical day is like for you now? How have you been taking care of yourself, and are there any activities or things that used to bring you joy that you've lost interest in since your mom passed away?

When you say that your brain feels foggy all the time, what do you think is contributing to that feeling? Is it just the grief and emotional pain, or are there other factors at play, such as lack of sleep, poor appetite, or social isolation?

Are you getting enough rest, eating nourishing foods, and engaging in some form of exercise or self-care? Sometimes, taking care of our physical health can help improve our mental clarity and focus.

It's like you're navigating a new reality without a map, and everything feels uncertain and scary. It's completely understandable that you'd feel lost and alone, especially when it seems like others around you are moving on with their lives.\n\nI want to explore this idea of feeling \"stuck\" in grief further with you. What do you think is holding you back from moving forward, even if it's just a tiny step at a time? Is it the fear of forgetting your mom or leaving her behind, or is it something else entirely? For example, are there any specific memories or emotions that you're struggling to process, or are there any self-criticisms or negative self-talk patterns that might be contributing to your feelings of stuckness?\n\nAlso, I want to ask, what do you think your mom would want for you right now? Would she want you to stay in this place of sadness and grief, or would she want you to find a way to heal and move forward, even if it's just in small ways?

It's like I'm stuck in this guilt and loyalty to her memory, and I don't know how to reconcile that with the need to take care of myself and move forward.\n\n*looks down, voice cracking* And I think you're right, it's also the fear of forgetting her. I'm scared that if I start to heal, I'll forget the little things about her, the way she smiled or the way she used to make me laugh. It's like I'm holding on to these memories so tightly because they're all I have left of her.\n\n*pauses again, collecting thoughts* As for what my mom would want for me... *smiles slightly* I think she would want me to be happy.

It's clear that you're carrying a deep sense of loyalty and love for your mom, and that's beautiful.\n\nI want to gently challenge this idea that moving forward means leaving your mom behind. What if, instead, you could find ways to honor her memory and keep her spirit alive in your life, even as you move forward? For example, are there specific traditions, habits, or rituals that you shared with your mom that you could continue to practice, even if it's just in a small way? Or are there new activities or hobbies that you could try, knowing that she would want you to be happy and fulfilled?\n\nIt's also important to recognize that memories are not something that can be forgotten or lost. They're a part of who you are, and they'll always be with you. The fear of forgetting your mom is understandable, but it's not necessarily a realistic one. You've had a lifetime of experiences and memories with her, and those will always be a part of you.\n\nI love that you smiled when thinking about what your mom would want for you. That tells me that there's a spark of hope and resilience within you, even in the midst of all this pain. And I think that's something we can build on.\n\nLet's explore this idea of imagining a future without your mom in it. What if, instead of picturing a blank slate, you could start to envision small, gentle steps towards healing and growth? For example, what would it be like to try a new hobby or activity that brings you joy, knowing that your mom would want you to be happy? Or what would it be like to reconnect with friends or family members who care about you, even if it feels scary or overwhelming at first?\n\nRemember, healing is not about forgetting or moving on from your mom's memory. It's about finding ways to integrate your loss into your life, and to find a new sense of purpose and meaning that still honors her love and legacy. And I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nHow does that sound? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or anything you'd like to explore further?"

I want to find a way to honor her memory and keep her spirit alive, like you said.\n\nI think one thing that might help is to start doing some of the things we used to do together again. Like, we used to love baking cookies together, and I haven't done that since she passed away. Maybe if I started doing that again, it would feel like I'm keeping a part of her with me.\n\nAnd I like what you said about trying new things and finding new joys. I've been feeling so stuck and numb for so long, it's hard to remember what it feels like to be happy or excited about something. But maybe if I started small, like trying a new recipe or taking a walk in a park, it could help me start to feel more alive again.\n\nIt's just... it's scary to think about moving forward without my mom. It feels like I'm betraying her or forgetting about her somehow. But at the same time, I know she would want me to be happy and fulfilled. She always wanted the best for me, and I know she wouldn't want me to stay stuck in this pain forever.\n\n*pauses, looking down* I guess what I need to work on is finding a way to balance my grief with my desire to move forward.

It's a beautiful and brave thing to acknowledge that you can't stay stuck in pain forever, and that you want to find ways to honor your mom's memory while also taking care of yourself.\n\nI love the idea of starting to do some of the things you used to do with your mom again, like baking cookies. That can be a powerful way to keep her memory alive and feel connected to her, even as you start to move forward.

It's a big change, and it's natural to wonder if you're doing the \"right\" thing. But I want to reassure you that there is no one \"right\" way to grieve or move forward. Everyone's journey is unique, and what's most important is that you're taking small steps towards healing and growth.\n\nRemember, honoring your mom's memory doesn't mean staying stuck in pain forever. It means finding ways to keep her spirit alive in your life, even as you start to rebuild and find new joys. And I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nLet's make a plan to start small, okay? Maybe we can start with one or two things that you used to do with your mom, like baking cookies or looking at old photos together. We can also brainstorm some new activities or hobbies that you might be interested in trying, and see if there are any small steps you can take towards getting started.\n\nAnd remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to have it all figured out right now. Just taking the first step, no matter how small it may seem, can be a powerful way to start moving forward. How does that sound?"

What's important is that you're taking small steps towards healing and growth, and that you're allowing yourself to feel your emotions and work through them.\n\nBefore we wrap up, I want to leave you with a gentle reminder: be kind to yourself, okay? Grieving is hard work, and it's okay to not be okay. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to \"get over\" your loss or to \"move on\" by a certain time. Just take things one day at a time, and trust that you're doing the best you can.\n\nAnd hey, if you ever need to talk or just need someone to listen, I'm here for you.

Are you connecting with friends and family, or are you feeling isolated?\n\nLastly, I want to leave you with a question to think about before our next conversation: What is one small thing you can do today to take care of yourself and honor your mom's memory? It could be something as simple as taking a few deep breaths, going for a short walk, or looking at some old photos. Whatever it is, I encourage you to take that small step towards healing and growth.\n\nRemember, I'm here to support you every step of the way.

It's funny, I was thinking about what we discussed earlier, and I realized that I've been feeling really overwhelmed by my emotions lately. Like, I'll be doing okay, and then suddenly I'll just feel this wave of sadness wash over me. But talking about it has helped me feel a bit more in control.\n\nPhysically, I'm still struggling with fatigue and not getting enough rest. Losing my mom has been exhausting, both emotionally and physically. But I've been trying to take care of myself by eating well and exercising when I can. I've also been trying to get outside more, whether it's just for a short walk or to sit in the garden. Being in nature seems to help me feel a bit more grounded.\n\nSocially...*sighs*...I'm still feeling a bit isolated, to be honest. It's hard to connect with friends and family when I'm feeling so overwhelmed by my grief. But talking to you has helped me realize that I don't have to go through this alone. Maybe reaching out to some close friends or family members would be a good place to start.\n\nAs for taking care of myself and honoring my mom's memory, I think one small thing I can do today is...*pauses, thinking*...look at some old photos of us together. I have a few albums that we made over the years, and going through those might help me feel more connected to her. Plus, it'll give me a chance to reminisce about happy times and memories, rather than just dwelling on my sadness.\n\nThanks again for listening and supporting me. It means so much to know that I have someone to talk to who understands what I'm going through."
