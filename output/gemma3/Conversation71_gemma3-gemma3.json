Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

It\u2019s wonderful to meet you, and I want you to know that you\u2019re in a safe and supportive space here. \n\nNow, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what\u2019s bringing you in today?

Specifically, what kind of movements are you doing? Is it tapping your feet, clicking a pen, pacing, something else? And can you give me a sense of *how long* this feeling of restlessness typically lasts \u2013 are there specific times of the day when it\u2019s worse, or does it just fluctuate throughout the day?"

It\u2019s worse in the evenings, I think. After work. Just\u2026 a general feeling of needing to *do* something, even if it\u2019s just shifting my position.

Let's explore that \u201cemptiness\u201d you mentioned. it\u2019s very common to seek out distractions when underlying feelings are unaddressed. let's start with this: when you say \u201cemptiness,\u201d can you describe that feeling more specifically? What *specifically* does it *feel* like? is it a feeling of sadness, loneliness, anxiety, something else entirely? and can you give me an example of a recent situation where you felt this emptiness most strongly?"

Let\u2019s just move past it. \n\nLet\u2019s focus on the feeling itself. When you experience this \u201cemptiness,\u201d is it predominantly linked to feelings of sadness, perhaps a sense of loss, or is it more akin to anxiety \u2013 a worry about something in the future, or a feeling of being overwhelmed? Or perhaps it's a combination of things? And could you describe the *intensity* of this feeling on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being a very mild sense of unease and 10 being an overwhelming, debilitating feeling?"

It sounds like there\u2019s a significant element of anxiety mixed in with this feeling of emptiness. \n\nLet's explore that a little further. Can you recall a specific event or situation in the *last week* where you noticed this feeling of emptiness and anxiety intensifying? It doesn\u2019t have to be a major event; even a relatively small interaction or thought can be a trigger. Just describe what happened, and *how* it made you feel, as accurately as you can."

    "content": "(Takes a breath, offering a supportive tone)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s unpack that. You described a conversation with your sister about her recent job search. You felt a pressure to offer encouragement, but underneath that, you felt a significant anxiety about her potential disappointment if she didn\u2019t find a new job quickly. You described it as a \u201ctightness\u201d in your chest and a feeling of needing to *fix* things, even though you knew it wouldn\u2019t help.\n\nNow, let\u2019s focus on the \"need to fix things.\u201d <<What is that you don't like about this need to fix things when your sister is struggling, and why?>> What\u2019s driving that urge to take control in a situation where you can't actually control the outcome?"

What specifically are you afraid will happen if things don't go according to your plan? Don't censor yourself; just tell me what\u2019s truly at the core of that fear."

It sounds like a significant part of this is tied to a fear of her disappointment and, perhaps, a fear of *your own* feelings if she were to be unhappy. \n\nLet\u2019s explore that a little more. When you imagine her being unhappy \u2013 if she doesn\u2019t find a new job quickly \u2013 what specifically are you afraid *you* will feel? Is it sadness? Anger? Guilt? Shame? Try to pinpoint the specific emotion you're anticipating, and let's rate the intensity of that fear on a scale of 1 to 10 \u2013 1 being a mild worry and 10 being an overwhelming, debilitating fear.

Let\u2019s hold onto that for a moment. \n\nNow, let's try a slightly different approach. You mentioned feeling a \"tightness\" in your chest when you think about her situation. Can you describe that sensation in more detail? What does it *feel* like physically? Is it a pressure, a constriction, a warmth, a coldness \u2013 and where in your body do you primarily experience it? Let\u2019s just focus on the physical sensations associated with that feeling."

When you notice this \u201ctightness\u201d in your chest, what\u2019s the *first* thought that comes into your mind? Is it a specific image, a phrase, or just a general feeling of unease?

Or to *fix* it? \n\nLet\u2019s explore that a little further. When you have that thought \u2013 whatever it may be \u2013 what\u2019s the *intensity* of that thought on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being a very mild awareness and 10 being an overwhelming, debilitating feeling?

Imagine for a moment that you *couldn\u2019t* fix things \u2013 that your sister\u2019s job search wouldn\u2019t go according to plan. What would be the *very first* thought you\u2019d have in that scenario?  Just one thought, Elias.

It\u2019s not necessarily about what she needs to hear, but about what *you* need to feel.\n\nLet\u2019s dig a little deeper.
