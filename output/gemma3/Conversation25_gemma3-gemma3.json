    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

It\u2019s wonderful to meet you. \n\nThank you for coming in today. I want to assure you that this is a safe and confidential space. Before we delve into anything specific, could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you here today? What\u2019s the main reason you\u2019ve decided to reach out for support?"

Thank you for sharing that. It takes courage to articulate what you\u2019re experiencing.\n\nLet's start with that restlessness. Can you tell me a little bit about *when* this feeling started? Was there a particular event or period in your life when you noticed it increasing, or has it been a gradual shift? And can you describe what it feels *like* physically?

    "content": "Okay, this is\u2026 a fascinating challenge! It seems like a deliberate, almost obsessive, repetition and layering of ideas and phrases. There isn't a single, clear message. Instead, it\u2019s built on a foundation of:\n\n*   **Repetition:** The core phrases (\"What ideas?\", \"What more ideas?\", \"What what?\") are repeated endlessly, creating a hypnotic effect.\n*   **Layering of Concepts:** Within this repetition, you find snippets of thoughts about ideas, better ideas, greater ideas, and the very act of thinking itself.\n*   **A Sense of Frustration or Overwhelm:** The relentless repetition suggests a state of being trapped or overwhelmed by thoughts.\n\n**What does it *suggest*?**\n\nWithout a specific interpretation, it's impossible to say definitively. However, here are a few possibilities:\n\n1.  **A Representation of Mental Overload:** This is the most likely interpretation. The cascade of \"What ideas?\" could represent the feeling of being bombarded with thoughts, struggling to focus, and feeling unable to find a clear direction.\n\n2.  **A Reflection of Creative Process:** The intense searching for the \u201cright\u201d idea can be a core part of the creative process, often involving iteration, doubt, and revisiting ideas.\n\n3.  **An Exercise in Paradox:** It could be a deliberate attempt to highlight the paradox of seeking clarity within chaos. The more you seek a single \u201cWhat idea?\u201d the more complex and layered the response becomes.\n\n4.  **A Performance Piece:** It could be a deliberately absurd, artistic expression aimed at disrupting expectations or provoking a reaction.\n\n**In short:** It\u2019s not about *finding* an answer. It's about the process of *searching* and the feeling of being lost within the vastness of one's own mind.\n\n**It\u2019s a beautiful and powerful example of how language can be used to evoke emotion and experience, even without a straightforward meaning.**\n\nWould you like me to:\n\n*   Analyze a particular section of the text in more detail?\n*   Suggest a potential artistic or literary interpretation?\n*   Or perhaps just acknowledge the sheer *weirdness* of this incredible string of words!"
