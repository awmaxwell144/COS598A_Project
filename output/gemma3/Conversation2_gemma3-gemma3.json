Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

I\u2019ve been working in this field for over eight years, primarily focusing on helping people understand and manage their thoughts and feelings to improve their daily lives. It\u2019s really wonderful of you to be here today.\n\nIt takes a lot of courage to reach out for support, so thank you for taking this step. \n\nTo start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today? What's been happening that led you to seek support now?"

When you say \u201cconstantly fidgeting,\u201d can you tell me a bit more about *what* that looks like for you? Are you tapping your feet, playing with objects, or something else? And when did you first notice this fidgeting starting? Was there anything specific happening around that time \u2013 a change in your environment, a stressful event, perhaps?"

I don't *mean* to, you know? It just\u2026 happens. \n\nI think it started, maybe, about a week ago? Before that, things were\u2026 normal. Then, this big thing happened.

When you\u2019re picking at things \u2013 what *specifically* are you picking at? Are there certain textures you gravitate towards, or perhaps specific objects that you find particularly difficult to resist? And when you say it\u2019s \u201cdifficult to resist,\u201d could you describe what that feels like internally? Is it a sense of urgency, a craving, or something else entirely?

Pretty thick. And I just\u2026 pull. It\u2019s not a conscious thing, really. It\u2019s like\u2026 the jacket just *needs* to be pulled.\n\nAnd when I do it, I feel\u2026 a little bit numb, I think. Like the rest of me is just\u2026 fading away. It's not a bad feeling, exactly. Just\u2026 distant.

When you say you\u2019re \u201cwatching yourself,\u201d what\u2019s going through your mind in that moment? Are there thoughts or images that come to you?

Like the world is muted, drained of feeling. And with that lack of color, there\u2019s a sense of\u2026 immense regret. Not about anything specific, just\u2026 a profound regret for things I\u2019ve *not* done, things I *could* have done. It\u2019s a heavy feeling.\n\nAnd regarding the number on that scale of 1 to 10... I\u2019d say a solid 7. A 7.
