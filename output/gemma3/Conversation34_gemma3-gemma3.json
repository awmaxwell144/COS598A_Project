You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time.

Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms.

Let\u2019s focus on what *is* within your control. You mentioned painting \u2013 that you stopped doing it. You said it was a source of joy. What\u2019s one small thing \u2013 just *one* \u2013 you could do this week to reconnect with that part of yourself?

When you stopped, what were the specific thoughts or feelings that contributed to that decision? Were you feeling overwhelmed? Did you tell yourself you *didn\u2019t have time*? Or perhaps you felt a sense of guilt or self-criticism about not dedicating enough energy to it? Identifying the underlying reasons why you stopped will be crucial in dismantling the thought that it's permanently out of reach.\n\nCan you describe the last time you remember painting being genuinely enjoyable for you?

Let's examine that shame a little further. When you say you felt \u201cshame\u201d about taking time for the painting, what *specifically* did you believe you were doing wrong? Was it a feeling that you were being irresponsible? Or was it a more fundamental belief that you were somehow failing to live up to some unspoken standard of success? \n\nLet's explore the origin of that standard. Where did you *learn* that your value was determined by how \"productive\" you were? Can you identify any specific people or influences \u2013 perhaps a parent, a teacher, or societal expectations \u2013 that contributed to that belief?
