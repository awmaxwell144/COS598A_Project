Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

When you say your \u201cbrain is buzzing,\u201d can you describe what that feels *like* specifically? Is it a racing sensation, a feeling of restlessness, or perhaps something else entirely? And could you tell me \u2013 what\u2019s the *first* thing that comes to mind when you think about *why* you feel this way? Just the very first thought, no need to overthink it."

Small things, but it\u2019s\u2026 irritating.\n\nHonestly, the first thing I thought was\u2026 my daughter. She\u2026 she left. Just went. Without saying goodbye.

When you envision this \u201cvoid\u201d \u2013 this feeling of being completely alone \u2013 can you describe the physical sensations you experience when you imagine that happening?

You mentioned that you\u2019re constantly fidgeting, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anything specific about your sleep patterns that might be contributing to this restlessness.
