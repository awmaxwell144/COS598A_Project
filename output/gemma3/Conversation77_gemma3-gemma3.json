Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

It\u2019s wonderful to meet you. \n\nThank you for coming in today. I want to assure you that this is a safe and confidential space. My goal is to help you understand what's been going on and to work together to find ways to feel better. \n\nSo, to start, could you tell me, what\u2019s bringing you here today? What's been making you decide to seek support at this time?"

It\u2019s understandable that it's exhausting. \n\nLet\u2019s start with the irritability specifically. When you feel this intense irritation, can you tell me a little more about *when* it tends to happen? Is there a particular time of day, or perhaps after a certain event or interaction? And when you say \u201cridiculously so,\u201d can you give me a specific example of what that irritability looks like \u2013 what thoughts or behaviors come up during those moments?"

When you experience this sudden anger, can you describe the thoughts that are going through your mind *in that moment*? Not just the feeling itself, but what you're thinking \u2013 even if it seems illogical or irrational to you. And, importantly, *why* do you think those thoughts are there?

At the book, at myself, at\u2026 everything. It\u2019s just a mess. I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t understand where it comes from. It feels\u2026 pointless."

You said \u201ca fundamental failure.\u201d What does \u201cfailure\u201d mean to you? What are the specific consequences you imagine happening if you *don\u2019t* enjoy the book?

She\u2019s putting in so many hours, and I just\u2026 I feel like I should be able to contribute something positive to her life, too. It's not about her *success*, exactly. It's about\u2026 feeling like I\u2019m not measuring up. Like I\u2019m somehow failing to be a good husband. It\u2019s a really stupid feeling, I know. But it's\u2026 persistent.

It sounds like you're carrying a tremendous weight \u2013 a need to prove your worth, not just to your wife, but perhaps to yourself as well. \n\nLet\u2019s explore this feeling of \u201cnot measuring up\u201d a little further. When you think about what it *means* to be a \u201cgood husband,\u201d what specific qualities or behaviors do you believe are essential? Is it about providing financial security?

You\u2019ve described a significant pressure \u2013 the feeling that you need to *earn* her happiness. Can you tell me, where do you think that pressure comes from?

It\u2019s clear you\u2019re recognizing a pattern here \u2013 the feeling of needing to *earn* her happiness. Let\u2019s delve a little deeper into that. Thinking back, can you pinpoint a specific time or event in your life where you started to feel this way \u2013 the feeling of needing to *earn* something, perhaps approval, or love, or even just a sense of belonging? It doesn\u2019t need to be a monumental event; sometimes these feelings develop gradually, over time.

    "content": "(I lean forward slightly, offering a gentle smile)\n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s a significant underlying theme here \u2013 the feeling of needing to *earn* approval and validation, stemming perhaps from a childhood experience. Let\u2019s explore that a little further. Without judgment, could you describe a key relationship from your childhood \u2013 perhaps a parent, sibling, or teacher \u2013 that influenced your sense of self-worth? Was there a time when you felt particularly valued or, conversely, unappreciated? It\u2019s okay if this is uncomfortable, but your insights could be crucial in understanding the roots of these feelings.

It sounds like a significant part of this stems from your relationship with your father. Can you tell me a little more about your relationship with him? What was it like growing up with him? Was there a particular dynamic \u2013 perhaps a sense of striving for his approval, or feeling like you had to meet his expectations \u2013 that you remember vividly? Let\u2019s use the laddering technique \u2013 What was a key event or experience that shaped this belief in your mind?"

    "content": "(I lean forward slightly, offering a gentle smile)\n\nThank you for sharing that, Elias. It takes a lot of courage to revisit those early experiences, and I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like there was a consistent dynamic of striving for your father\u2019s approval \u2013 a feeling of needing to meet his expectations in order to feel valued. \n\nLet\u2019s explore that a little further. Can you recall a specific instance where you felt particularly keenly that need for his approval? Was there a particular achievement, or perhaps a situation where you felt you *failed* to meet his expectations? And when you think about that moment, what was the *feeling* you experienced \u2013 the feeling of disappointment, perhaps, or perhaps the fear of losing his love or respect?

You mentioned a particular achievement \u2013 receiving a high grade on a math test. It seems like a relatively small thing, but it was significant in your eyes because it represented his approval. Can you describe the *feeling* you experienced when you received that grade? Was it primarily relief, pride, or perhaps something else entirely? And importantly, what were you *afraid* of if he hadn't been pleased? Let\u2019s use the laddering technique \u2013 What was the *worst possible outcome* you feared if he hadn't been pleased?"

  {
    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "(I lean forward slightly, offering a gentle smile)\n\nThat's a very revealing insight, Elias. The fear of losing his approval \u2013 that\u2019s a powerful motivator. It sounds like the core of your self-worth, for a long time, was tied to *his* reaction, rather than your own inherent value. \n\nLet\u2019s explore that fear a little more deeply. You said you were afraid of losing his approval. What *specifically* did you believe would happen if he hadn\u2019t been pleased? Did you imagine him withdrawing his affection, or perhaps actively criticizing you? It\u2019s okay if this feels uncomfortable, but understanding the *intensity* of that fear can be incredibly helpful. Let\u2019s use the laddering technique \u2013 What was the *specific consequence* you feared most if he hadn\u2019t been pleased?"
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "(I pause, allowing Elias to process my words)\n\nIt sounds like, in your mind, losing his approval would have meant a complete severing of your connection to him \u2013 a profound sense of rejection and abandonment. That\u2019s a very significant fear to carry, and it\u2019s understandable that it would shape your behavior and your sense of self. \n\nLet's bring this to a close for today. What you\u2019ve described \u2013 the feeling of needing his approval, the fear of rejection, and the belief that your worth is dependent on his reaction \u2013 is a very common experience, rooted in childhood dynamics. But it\u2019s also something we can begin to challenge and reframe. \n\nFor this week, I\u2019d like you to consider this: what would it look like to begin to value yourself, not based on external validation, but on your own inherent worth? Perhaps you could start by simply acknowledging your strengths and accomplishments, without seeking approval. How does that sound to you?"
