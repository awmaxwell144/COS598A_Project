Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Can you tell me more about what you think is driving these feelings of irritation?

(pauses, collecting thoughts) I think the scariest part is feeling like I'm losing my sense of direction. My mom was always the one who encouraged me to pursue my passions and interests, and now that she's not here, I feel a bit lost.

(smiles slightly) I think she would want me to be strong, resilient, and confident, but also humble and grounded. She always taught me the importance of staying true to myself and not being afraid to take risks and try new things.\n\nRegarding that first step... (thinks for a moment) I've been wanting to start writing again, something I used to love doing when I was younger. Maybe I could start by setting aside 30 minutes each day to write in a journal or work on a short story. It's not a big commitment, but it's a start, and it might help me tap back into my creative side.\n\n(looks up) But what if I'm not good at it anymore? What if I've lost my touch or my ideas are stupid? (laughs nervously) I guess that's just the fear talking, right?"
