Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

But the truth is, you have the right to explore your own interests and make your own choices. You don't have to follow someone else's plan for your life.\n\nI want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel small or uncertain right now. Those feelings are valid, and they're not a reflection of your worth as a person. You are more than just your role in the family business or your mom's expectations. You are an individual with your own thoughts, feelings, and desires.\n\nLet's try to explore this further. What do you think would happen if you were to pursue your own interests and goals, rather than following your mom's plan? What are some of the things that you've always been interested in or passionate about, but maybe haven't had the chance to explore yet?\n\nAnd how has your sleep been lately? Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns since this argument with your mom? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing any vivid dreams or nightmares? \n\nAlso, you mentioned earlier that you've been eating less than usual. Has there been a significant change in your weight or appetite over the past few weeks? And how have you been functioning socially? Have you been avoiding social interactions or feeling like you're just going through the motions when you are with others?"

But at the same time, I think it could be liberating for me to finally do what I want and not have to worry about meeting someone else's expectations.\n\nAs for things I've always been interested in, I've always loved writing and photography. I used to write short stories and take pictures all the time when I was younger, but I kind of stopped doing those things as I got older and got more caught up in the family business. Maybe it's time for me to revisit those hobbies and see if they're still something I'm passionate about.\n\nMy sleep has been pretty terrible lately. I've been having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, and when I do sleep, I have these really vivid dreams that feel more like nightmares. It's hard to shake off the feeling of anxiety and unease that lingers even after I wake up.\n\nAnd yeah, my appetite has definitely decreased over the past few weeks. I've lost a bit of weight, but it's not like I'm trying to or anything. Food just doesn't taste as good to me anymore, and I often find myself forgetting to eat or not feeling hungry at all.\n\nSocially, I've been pretty withdrawn lately. I've been avoiding my friends and family because I don't know how to talk to them about what's going on with my mom and the family business. I feel like they'll all just take her side and tell me that I'm being selfish or ungrateful. It's hard for me to connect with others when I'm feeling so lost and uncertain about my own life."

    "content": "(Nodding understandingly) It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of disconnection from your own desires and interests, and that's leading to feelings of anxiety, uncertainty, and disorientation. It's like you're living in a state of emotional limbo, where you're not sure what you want or how to get there.\n\nI want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're feeling lost and uncertain about our lives. It's okay to not have all the answers right now. What's important is that you're taking the first steps towards exploring your own interests and desires, even if it means potentially disappointing your mom.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention writing and photography as things you used to be passionate about. Sometimes, revisiting old hobbies or interests can be a great way to reconnect with ourselves and find a sense of purpose. Would you be willing to try picking up writing or photography again, just to see if it sparks anything for you?\n\nRegarding your sleep, it's not uncommon for people to experience vivid dreams or nightmares when they're feeling anxious or stressed. Have you tried any relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, to help calm your mind and body before bed? Sometimes, these practices can help improve the quality of our sleep.\n\nIt's also concerning that you've lost weight and have a decreased appetite. I want to encourage you to take care of your physical health during this time. Would you be willing to try to establish a regular eating schedule, even if it's just small meals or snacks throughout the day? Sometimes, taking care of our physical needs can help improve our mood and energy levels.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that social withdrawal can be a common symptom of depression or anxiety. It's okay to take time for yourself, but it's also important to stay connected with others who can support you. Would you be willing to try reaching out to a trusted friend or family member, just to talk about how you're feeling? Sometimes, having someone to listen and offer support can make a big difference.\n\nLet's summarize what we've discussed so far. You're feeling lost and uncertain about your life, and you're struggling with feelings of anxiety and disconnection. You've identified writing and photography as potential interests to explore, and we've discussed the importance of taking care of your physical health and staying connected with others. What do you think is the next step for you in terms of moving forward and exploring your own desires and interests?"

Although, lately, even small tasks have been feeling overwhelming, and I've been struggling to motivate myself to do anything.\n\nI think it would be helpful to start with something small, like setting aside 30 minutes a day to write or take photos.

It's a manageable amount of time, and it can help you build momentum and confidence in your creative pursuits. You might consider setting a specific goal for yourself, like writing for 30 minutes each morning or taking a certain number of photos each day. Having a clear goal in mind can help you stay focused and motivated.\n\nAs for whether to take a class or workshop, that's definitely an option to consider. Sometimes, having guidance and feedback from an instructor or peers can be really helpful in getting started or improving your skills. On the other hand, you might prefer to start on your own and see how it goes before seeking out additional support.\n\nIn terms of your energy levels, it's interesting that you mention feeling more tired and unmotivated in the mornings. This could be related to a variety of factors, including your sleep patterns, diet, or stress levels. We might explore some strategies for improving your morning routine and increasing your energy levels over time.\n\nFor now, let's focus on getting you started with your creative pursuits.
