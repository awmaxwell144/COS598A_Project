Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that this condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden.",

How have you been taking care of yourself, physically and emotionally? For example, are you eating regularly, exercising, or engaging in any activities that bring you comfort or relaxation?

I haven't been eating much, either - I just don't seem to have an appetite anymore. And exercise? Forget about it... I haven't had the energy for that in weeks. (pauses) As for sleep, it's been weird. Sometimes I'll fall asleep fine, but then I'll wake up in the middle of the night and lie there for hours, unable to go back to sleep.

It's not like I'm trying to or anything, I just don't feel like eating most of the time.

And that's making it even harder for you to take care of your physical and emotional needs.\n\nI want to gently challenge this idea that you're \"not worth taking care of.\" What makes you think that you're not deserving of love, care, and compassion - not just from others, but from yourself? Is it possible that this is a deeply ingrained pattern of thinking that's been with you for a while, and not just something that started with your job loss?\n\nI also want to explore the idea that finding a new job will automatically give you a sense of purpose. While having a job can certainly provide structure and meaning, it's not the only source of purpose in life. What are some other things that have given you a sense of purpose or fulfillment in the past? Was it volunteering, spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or something else?\n\nAnd finally, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling with feelings of worthlessness or self-doubt. It's okay to feel this way, and it doesn't mean that there's anything inherently wrong with you. Can you think of any small acts of self-care or kindness that you could offer yourself today - not because you \"deserve\" it, but simply because you exist and are worthy of care?"

But it's hard to think about what else could give me purpose when I'm feeling so lost and unsure of myself.\n\n(looks up slightly) You know, it's weird... when you said \"small acts of self-care or kindness,\" something came to mind. My mom used to make me this really comforting soup when I was feeling down, and I haven't had it in years. Maybe I could try making that for myself today? It sounds silly, but it might be a good place to start, right?"
  },
  {
    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "It's like the weight of others' expectations, combined with your own self-doubt, is making you feel like you're not living up to your potential. But here's the thing: your worth and value as a person are not defined by your career or your achievements. You are more than your job, and you are more than your perceived successes or failures.\n\nI love that you mentioned your mom's comforting soup! That's a great example of a small act of self-care that can bring you comfort and joy. It's not silly at all - in fact, it's a beautiful way to nurture yourself and tap into positive memories. Making that soup for yourself today could be a wonderful way to start practicing self-compassion and kindness.\n\nLet's explore this idea further: what is it about your mom's soup that makes you feel comforted and cared for? Is it the taste, the smell, the memory of her making it for you, or something else entirely? And how might you be able to incorporate more of those comforting elements into your daily life, even if it's just in small ways?\n\nAlso, I want to gently challenge this idea that your friends are \"doing so much better\" than you. Social media often presents a curated version of people's lives, and it's easy to compare and feel like we're coming up short. But the truth is, everyone has their own struggles and challenges, even if they don't always show it. Can you think of any ways in which you might be comparing your behind-the-scenes moments to others' highlight reels, and how that might be affecting your self-perception?"

She would always make it when I was feeling down or sick, and it just reminds me of her love and care. It's like a warm hug in a bowl.\n\n(pauses, reflects on the question) And yeah, I can see how I've been comparing my life to my friends' social media posts. It's easy to get caught up in thinking that everyone else has their life together, but that's probably not true. I mean, nobody posts about their failures or struggles on Instagram, right? (smiles slightly)\n\n(looks down, then back up) You know, just talking about this stuff is helping me feel a little better. It's like I'm starting to see that my worth and value aren't defined by my job or what others think of me. But it's hard to shake off the feeling that I've let everyone down, including myself.\n\n(trails off, then looks up) Do you think... do you think it's possible for me to forgive myself for not living up to my own expectations? Or for not being where I thought I'd be in life?"
  },

    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "It's like the weight of self-criticism and disappointment is still lingering, making it hard for you to fully let go of the feeling that you've let yourself and others down.\n\nI want to assure you that forgiveness - especially self-forgiveness - is a process, and it's okay if it takes time. It's possible to work towards forgiving yourself for not meeting your own expectations or for not being where you thought you'd be in life. In fact, it's a crucial step towards healing and moving forward.\n\nOne way to start this process is to practice self-compassion and acknowledge that everyone has their own unique journey and timeline. It's okay if your path isn't linear or if you've encountered setbacks along the way. You can try to reframe your thinking by focusing on what you've learned from your experiences, rather than dwelling on what didn't go as planned.\n\nRemember that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people struggle with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, even if they don't always show it. And it's okay to acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay.\n\nNow, I want to ask: what do you think would happen if you were to offer yourself the same kindness, understanding, and compassion that you would offer to a friend in a similar situation? How might that change your inner dialogue and your relationship with yourself?\n\nAnd finally, I want to leave you with a gentle suggestion: what if you were to write yourself a letter of forgiveness and self-compassion? What would you say to yourself, and how might that help you release some of the guilt and shame that's been weighing on you?"
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "(nods slowly) I think... I think it would be really helpful to offer myself kindness and compassion like I would to a friend. It's funny, I can be so understanding and supportive of others when they're struggling, but when it comes to myself, I'm always so critical.\n\n(pauses, reflects on the idea) If I were to write a letter to myself, I think I would say something like... \"It's okay that things didn't work out as planned. It's okay that you're not where you thought you'd be in life. You're doing the best you can, and that's enough.\" (smiles slightly) Just saying that out loud feels a little bit liberating.\n\n(looks down, then back up) I think what's been holding me back is this idea that I need to have everything figured out and be perfect all the time. But that's just not realistic, and it's not fair to myself. Maybe it's okay to not have all the answers, and maybe it's okay to make mistakes.\n\n(takes a deep breath) You know, I think I'm starting to see that forgiveness - especially self-forgiveness - is not about erasing the past or pretending like everything is fine when it's not. It's about acknowledging the pain and the struggles, but also acknowledging my own humanity and fallibility. And maybe... just maybe... that's where healing can start.\n\n(smiles softly) Thank you for listening and for helping me see things from a different perspective. I feel like I have a lot to think about and work through, but for the first time in a while, I'm feeling a glimmer of hope."
