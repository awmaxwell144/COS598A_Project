Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

That constant restlessness, especially when it\u2019s interrupting something you used to enjoy like reading, is a significant shift. \n\nLet\u2019s unpack this a little. Could you tell me more about *when* this restlessness started? Was there a specific event or period in your life when you first noticed it becoming more pronounced?

When you say it\u2019s overwhelming, what specifically makes it feel overwhelming? Is it the *intensity* of the thoughts, the *frequency* of them, or something else entirely?

When you hear yourself think, \u201cNo one cares,\u201d what *specifically* does that thought tell you about yourself and your work? What\u2019s the worst-case scenario it\u2019s imagining? <<What is that you don't like about the thought \"No one cares\" and why?>>"

It\u2019s quite common for people to tie their self-worth to external achievements, and it can be a very vulnerable place to be.\n\nLet\u2019s dig a little deeper into that need for validation. When you imagine receiving positive feedback on your writing, what does *that* feedback actually *represent* to you? Is it simply external praise, or does it represent something more fundamental, like a sense of belonging or worthiness?

What you're describing is a profound need for validation, a deep-seated belief that your worth is intrinsically tied to external recognition. And it sounds like this belief is rooted in a significant experience \u2013 a past event that fostered this particular connection between your self-worth and external approval.\n\nYou've spoken about a \"vulnerable\" feeling associated with that belief.

What\u2019s the worst-case scenario you're imagining when you feel this vulnerable \u2013 that \u201cneed\u201d for external validation?

It\u2019s remarkable how often underlying this can be a key component that contributes to the current state, and it\u2019s a very useful step to look into.\n\nLet's take a step back and try to understand the roots of that vulnerable feeling. When you consider the times you\u2019ve felt most truly valued, and you imagine someone dismissing or rejecting those feelings - what is the *core* fear that\u2019s driving to you? What\u2019s the underlying message in doing so would imply that would deeply frighten or distress you?\n\nIs it a fear of abandonment, a fear of being seen as inadequate, or something else entirely? <<What do you most fear that's driving when you see someone dismissing your feelings, and why?>>"

You\u2019ve articulated it beautifully\u2014the core fear being that your feelings simply won\u2019t matter.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that a little. When you think about that moment, that feeling of being dismissed, can you describe the *sensations* you experience in your body? Is it a tightness in your chest, a knot in your stomach, a feeling of coldness, or something else entirely? It\u2019s not about diagnosing anything, just about becoming more aware of the physical manifestations of this feeling. And\u2014it's a bit of a big question\u2014can you pinpoint *when* this feeling of being dismissed first emerged in your life? Was there a particular person, a specific event, or a period of time that you associate with it? <<Can you describe a single memory where you felt truly dismissed, and tell me what happened at that moment?>>"

Could you paint a picture for me, as vividly as you can, of what you were doing *at that moment*? What were the immediate circumstances? Who was present? And, most importantly, what were you *thinking* in that instant \u2013 before the feeling of dismissal fully took hold?
