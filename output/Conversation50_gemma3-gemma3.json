    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

It\u2019s wonderful to meet you. \n\nThank you for coming in today. It takes a lot of courage to reach out, and I want you to know that you\u2019re in a safe and supportive space. \n\nTo start, could you tell me \u2013 what\u2019s brought you here today?

Can you tell me, when did you first start noticing this feeling of being unable to sit still? Was there a specific event or period in your life that seemed to coincide with the beginning of this sensation? And could you describe what it *feels* like specifically? Is it a physical sensation \u2013 perhaps a buzzing, a tension, or something else entirely?"

Like a\u2026 a low hum, maybe? It\u2019s not a sharp pain, just\u2026 a constant jitter. And it\u2019s not just pacing. I find myself fidgeting, clicking pens, just\u2026 needing to *move*.

If you could describe that feeling of calm, what\u2019s the *quality* of it? Is it a gentle warmth? A quiet stillness? A sense of spaciousness? And, when you\u2019re experiencing that calm, can you notice any specific physical sensations \u2013 perhaps a slowing of your breath, a relaxed posture, or a feeling of lightness?"

Just\u2026 spaciousness. And a quiet warmth, like sunlight on skin. \n\nBut\u2026 the restlessness\u2026 it\u2019s a tightness. Like a knot in my stomach. And a buzzing in my chest. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s pulling me outwards. Away. It\u2019s not painful, exactly, but it's\u2026 insistent."

Let\u2019s hold onto that image of the \u201cpulling sensation.\u201d When this \u201cpulling\u201d happens, what triggers it?

It doesn't need to be a major event \u2013 even a small interaction, a particular thought, or a specific place could be a trigger.

But as I was standing in line, this feeling started. It was\u2026 almost immediately. I was looking at the prices, trying to decide between skim and 2%, and then *bam*, the pulling started. It felt like\u2026 like I needed to *move*, to *scan* the shelves, to *find* something. It wasn\u2019t a panic, exactly, just this insistent need to be doing *something*. I ended up grabbing a cart and started just wandering around, looking at everything. It lasted maybe ten minutes, but it felt like an eternity."

A need for stimulation? Or perhaps something else entirely \u2013 like a feeling of being overwhelmed or out of control?

I don\u2019t want to waste time.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a conscious decision, exactly, but it felt like this pressure \u2013 this feeling that if I wasn\u2019t *actively* doing something, I was\u2026 failing. Like I was letting time slip away. And\u2026 there was a little voice in my head saying, \"You should be *doing* something with your time.\" It was\u2026judgmental, almost."

  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "(Gentle, encouraging tone)\n\nThank you for articulating that so honestly \u2013 that little judgmental voice. It's incredibly insightful to recognize that it's not simply a need to *do* something, but a fear of *wasting* time. That\u2019s a powerful driver, and it often underlies these kinds of restlessness. \n\nLet\u2019s explore that fear a little more. Can you tell me \u2013 where do you think that fear of wasting time comes from? Is it a feeling you\u2019ve had for a long time? Are there specific experiences in your past that might have contributed to this feeling \u2013 perhaps a time when you felt you weren't meeting expectations, or when you felt like you weren't achieving something?"

    "content": "(Longer pause \u2013 a visible effort to respond)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a really difficult question. I think\u2026 it goes back pretty far. My dad\u2026 he was always busy. Always doing *something*. Building things, fixing things, always \u201cproductive.\u201d He\u2019d get really frustrated if I wasn\u2019t helping him, or if I was just\u2026 relaxing. It wasn\u2019t that he was angry, exactly, but there was this\u2026 expectation. This feeling that time was valuable, and it should be used productively. I think\u2026 I internalized that. I always felt this pressure to be *doing* something, to be useful. It wasn't until recently, I started to question that. It's\u2026 complicated."

  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "(Softly, with empathy)\n\nThank you for sharing that, Elias. It takes a great deal of courage to talk about these things, particularly those originating from our families. It sounds like you\u2019ve carried this feeling \u2013 this pressure to be productive \u2013 for a very long time. And it\u2019s clear that your father\u2019s expectations had a profound impact on you. \n\nLet\u2019s gently explore that a little further. When you think about your father\u2019s expectations, what specifically did he *value* most? Was it efficiency? Achievement? Or perhaps something else \u2013 like a sense of security or belonging, conveyed through being actively involved and \u201cuseful\u201d? And, importantly, when you\u2019re *now* recognizing this inherited pressure, what feelings arise for you? Is there any sense of resentment, sadness, or perhaps even a sense of\u2026 longing?"
