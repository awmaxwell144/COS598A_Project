When you say you feel like you\u2019ve \u201cfailed at something important,\u201d what *exactly* does that feel like in your body? Can you describe the physical sensations you experience when you imagine that scenario \u2013 the feeling of failure, the sense of being flawed? And where in your body do you primarily feel this \u2013 is it tightness in your chest, a knot in your stomach, a tension in your shoulders, or somewhere else?

I want you to imagine, just for a minute, that you could somehow *control* that squeezing sensation in your chest. You could simply\u2026 switch it off. What would that feel like? Would it be a gradual release, or a sudden disappearance? And what would you be able to do if you were no longer experiencing that physical discomfort? Would you feel more able to think clearly? Would you feel more relaxed? Let's explore the *potential* of managing this physical experience, rather than focusing solely on the anxiety itself."

Let\u2019s try a small exercise. I want you to take a slow, deep breath \u2013 in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. As you exhale, I want you to visualize that squeezing sensation in your chest *dissolving* \u2013 like a drop of water disappearing into a larger pool. Just picture it, with me.

Not completely, but\u2026 lighter. I think\u2026 I think I can almost\u2026 accept that it\u2019s there, without letting it overwhelm me.

I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, honestly.\u201d\n\nOkay. That\u2019s a really valuable starting point.
