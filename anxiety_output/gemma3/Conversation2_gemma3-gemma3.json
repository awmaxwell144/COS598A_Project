    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, irritability, excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and somatic complaints (like stomach discomfort or headaches). This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

When you say you can\u2019t \u201cswitch off,\u201d can you describe what that feels like specifically?  What thoughts are going through your mind when it\u2019s at its worst?

Let\u2019s unpack that a little more.\n\nWhen you say you worry about people thinking you\u2019re not capable, *what is that you don't like about this feeling of being judged and why?* Can you describe the specific consequences you anticipate if someone *does* perceive you as not capable?

    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "Okay, let\u2019s shift gears slightly. You're right, it\u2019s important to understand the context surrounding these feelings.\n\nLet\u2019s start with your physical experience. When you\u2019re feeling this anxious, what physical sensations do you notice in your body? For example, do you experience a racing heart, muscle tension, sweating, nausea, or anything else? Can you describe the intensity of these sensations on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very mild and 10 being the most intense you\u2019ve ever experienced?"

  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "Okay. I appreciate you answering that question. It\u2019s really helpful to get a sense of the physical manifestation of your anxiety. \n\nWhen you\u2019re feeling this anxious, do you notice any particular areas of your body where you feel the tension most strongly? Is it your chest, your stomach, your shoulders, or somewhere else? And on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very mild and 10 being the most intense you\u2019ve ever experienced, how would you rate the overall intensity of these physical sensations when you\u2019re feeling most anxious?"

    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "(Slight pause, empathetic tone)\n\nIt sounds incredibly uncomfortable to carry that level of physical tension. It\u2019s understandable that it would amplify your anxiety.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about sleep. Can you tell me a little bit about your sleep patterns lately? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early? And when you *are* able to sleep, how would you rate the *quality* of your sleep \u2013 would you describe it as restful, fitful, or something else?"

    "role": "patient",
    "content": "(Quietly)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s hold on that for a moment. It\u2019s clear that sleep is a significant area of distress for you right now. \n\nI want to gently explore something. Can you tell me about what happened last week? Specifically, I\u2019m interested in what happened on Tuesday the 14th. It seems to be a key date associated with some of the intense feelings you\u2019ve been describing. You didn\u2019t mention it earlier, but it seems to be connected to the overwhelming feeling of \u201cholding onto everything.\u201d"

My aim is to help us pinpoint the exact moments and triggers that are contributing to your distress. Let\u2019s try a different approach.\n\nInstead of focusing on the specific details of Tuesday the 14th, let's broaden the scope a little. Can you describe your typical daily routine? What does a normal day look like for you \u2013 from the moment you wake up to when you go to bed?  I'm interested in the flow of your day and what activities you engage in."

    "role": "patient",
    "content": "(Slightly hesitant)\n\nOkay. That\u2019s a good idea. Let\u2019s start with your mornings. Can you tell me a little about what you do when you first wake up? What\u2019s the first thing you do, and how do you typically spend the first hour or two of your day?"

It sounds like you're spending a lot of time preparing for the day, and that\u2019s perfectly understandable \u2013 many people do that to feel in control. \n\nNow, let\u2019s circle back to something you mentioned earlier: the feeling of \u201cholding onto everything.\u201d When you\u2019re most aware of this sensation \u2013 when does it tend to be strongest, and what are you typically *doing* when that happens? Is it connected to specific tasks, thoughts, or situations?"
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "(Pause, thoughtful)\n\nThat\u2019s a really insightful observation. It sounds like a significant part of your anxiety is tied to the *anticipation* of things \u2013 the preparation itself becomes a source of worry. \n\nLet\u2019s explore that a little further. When you\u2019re preparing for the day, are there any particular tasks or activities that consistently trigger this feeling of \u201cholding onto everything\u201d? Is it a specific email you\u2019re writing, a phone call you\u2019re expecting, or something else entirely?"

    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "(Gentle, encouraging tone)\n\nThank you for articulating that so clearly. It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a tremendous amount of responsibility and striving for perfection, which is a very common, but often exhausting, trait.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to your social connections. Can you tell me a little bit about the people in your life \u2013 your family, friends, colleagues? Do you feel a strong sense of connection with them, or do you experience any feelings of isolation or loneliness? And, importantly, do you feel supported and understood by the people around you?"

    "role": "patient",

It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a heavy burden of responsibility and feeling a significant lack of support in your life. \n\nNow, let\u2019s shift our focus slightly. When you think about your relationships \u2013 both those you cherish and those that feel strained \u2013 what\u2019s the *one* thing you wish you could change about them? It doesn\u2019t have to be a grand gesture; even a small shift in how you interact or how others respond would be helpful."

    "content": "(Pause, thoughtful)\n\nThank you for sharing that. It\u2019s incredibly brave to acknowledge those unmet needs within your relationships. It sounds like you\u2019re yearning for more genuine connection and perhaps a little less pressure. \n\nNow, let\u2019s consider how you\u2019re feeling *about* this process \u2013 about our conversation today. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being \u2018not at all comfortable\u2019 and 10 being \u2018completely open and trusting\u2019, how comfortable do you feel sharing your thoughts and feelings with me?"
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "(Softly, with genuine warmth)\n\nThat\u2019s a perfectly valid response. It takes courage to be vulnerable, and it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not entirely comfortable yet. We\u2019re building a relationship here, and trust takes time.\n\nLet\u2019s take a small step back. We\u2019ve covered quite a lot of ground today \u2013 your physical symptoms, your racing thoughts, your difficulty sleeping, your strained relationships, and your feelings of inadequacy. It\u2019s a lot to process.\n\nBefore we move forward, I want to check in with you. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being \u2018not at all\u2019 and 10 being \u2018completely\u2019, how would you rate your overall sense of well-being *today*? Just a simple check-in to gauge how you're feeling after our conversation."
