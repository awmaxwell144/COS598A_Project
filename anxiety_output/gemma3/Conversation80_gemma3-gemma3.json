Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Like if I failed, if I couldn't achieve something I\u2019d set my mind to, then\u2026 I was truly, utterly *nothing*. It was a terrifying thought.

Many people, particularly those who grew up in environments where achievement was highly valued, internalize this very strong connection between their self-worth and their accomplishments.\n\nLet\u2019s explore this a little further. You mentioned \u201ctrying to convince yourself otherwise.\u201d What specific thoughts or strategies did you use \u2013 consciously or unconsciously \u2013 to combat this feeling of \u201cceasing to exist\u201d?

You\u2019re right; it\u2019s a persistent shadow.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that shame a little more. When you say you felt \u2018shame,\u2019 what specifically *did* that shame feel like in your body? Did you notice any physical sensations \u2013 a tightness in your chest, a knot in your stomach, a feeling of heat in your face? Often, these physical sensations are a direct reflection of the emotional experience, and understanding them can be a powerful tool in managing the anxiety. Would you be willing to describe those sensations for me?"
