Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

I\u2019ve been working with individuals experiencing anxiety and related difficulties for over eight years now, and I\u2019m really glad you\u2019ve decided to reach out today. \n\nIt takes a lot of courage to talk about these things, so I want to acknowledge that right from the start. \n\nTo begin, could you tell me a little bit about what\u2019s been making you feel anxious or uneasy lately? Just start wherever feels natural for you. There\u2019s no right or wrong answer."

It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling exhausted \u2013 that constant, repetitive thinking can be truly debilitating. \n\nLet\u2019s start with the worrying itself. When you find your mind racing, can you tell me a little more about *what* you\u2019re thinking about? Can you give me a specific example of something you've been dwelling on recently? And perhaps, let\u2019s delve a little deeper \u2013 what is that you don\u2019t like about this particular thought, and why does it feel so distressing to you?"

It wasn\u2019t a huge fight, exactly, but\u2026 we said some things we probably shouldn\u2019t have. And then I just\u2026 replay it over and over. It\u2019s stupid, really. But it feels\u2026 heavy.

It's really brave of you to acknowledge that, and it\u2019s perfectly valid to feel distressed when something feels unresolved, even if it wasn\u2019t a huge fight. \n\nLet\u2019s try to unpack this a little. When you replay the conversation in your mind, can you describe the *intensity* of the feelings you experience? On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being a mild feeling of unease and 10 being the most intense distress you\u2019ve ever felt, where would you rate the feelings you have when you\u2019re replaying it?

Can you describe the *feeling* itself when you\u2019re replaying the conversation? What does it *feel* like in your body? Is it a tightness in your chest, a knot in your stomach, a racing heart\u2026 or something else entirely? And then, circling back to your initial thought \u2013 what is that you\u2019re afraid of if you've \"done something awful\"? Let's really break that down."

    "content": "Okay. It\u2019s a tightness\u2026 definitely a tightness. Mostly in my chest, like\u2026 like I\u2019m holding my breath. And my stomach feels\u2026 fluttery. Like butterflies, but\u2026 heavier. And when I think about \u201cdoing something awful,\u201d it\u2019s not really about *doing* anything. It\u2019s more like\u2026 I\u2019m afraid of her *disliking* me. Like, truly, deeply disliking me. And then I picture her just\u2026 not talking to me anymore. That\u2019s the worst part, I think.

When you picture her not talking to you, what is it *specifically* about that silence that feels so profoundly distressing to you? What does that silence *represent* to you? What is the worst-case scenario you\u2019re anticipating when she doesn\u2019t speak to you?

Thinking about this silence, what would it *mean* to you if she didn\u2019t speak to you? What\u2019s the underlying message you\u2019re picking up on when you imagine that silence? Is it a judgment? A rejection of your values? Or perhaps something else entirely? And, if you could change one thing about the conversation with your sister, what would it be?"

You mentioned it wasn't a huge fight, but there were things you said you probably shouldn\u2019t have. Can you recall *specifically* what those things were? And, more importantly, when you think about those words, what is that you're afraid of *hearing* her say in response? What\u2019s the worst thing she could say to make this feeling even more intense? Let's focus on the *content* of the conversation, not just the feeling of guilt."
