Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

I\u2019ve been working with individuals experiencing anxiety and related difficulties for over eight years now. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for support, and I want you to know you\u2019ve taken a really positive first step. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re experiencing some distress, and my goal today is to understand what\u2019s going on and to work together to find ways to manage it. \n\nTo start, could you tell me a little bit about what\u2019s been making you feel anxious or uneasy lately? Just start wherever feels most natural for you."

    "content": "That sounds incredibly frustrating. The feeling of being unable to settle \u2013 it\u2019s completely understandable why that would be distressing. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re caught in a current. \n\nLet\u2019s unpack that a little. When you say you can\u2019t \u201cshake it off,\u201d can you tell me a little more about *what* that feeling is like?  Specifically, can you describe the feeling itself? Is it a specific kind of anxiety \u2013 like fear, worry, restlessness \u2013 or something else entirely? And if it\u2019s worry, what are you typically worrying *about*?"

    "role": "patient",
    "content": "It\u2019s\u2026 a tightness. Mostly in my chest, but it kind of spreads. Like\u2026 a knot. And I just can't seem to breathe properly sometimes. It\u2019s exhausting."
  },
  {
    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "Okay, that\u2019s really helpful to understand that physical sensation \u2013 the tightness in your chest and the difficulty breathing. It sounds incredibly uncomfortable and, as you say, exhausting. \n\nLet\u2019s delve a little deeper into that physical response. When you notice this tightness and difficulty breathing, can you describe the intensity on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is very mild and 10 is the most intense you\u2019ve ever experienced? And importantly, how long does this typically last when it occurs? Are there specific triggers that seem to bring it on, or does it often come on seemingly out of nowhere?"

    "role": "patient",
    "content": "It\u2019s usually around a 6 or 7. And honestly, it just\u2026 appears. Like, I\u2019ll be reading, or trying to watch something on TV, and suddenly it\u2019s there. It doesn\u2019t really build up, you know? It\u2019s just\u2026 *there*. I don\u2019t know what sets it off, really."

The sudden appearance of the intensity \u2013 a 6 or 7 \u2013 and the lack of a clear build-up\u2026 that suggests there might be a significant element of unpredictability to these episodes. \n\nLet\u2019s explore that a little more. When this intense feeling \u2013 the tightness, the difficulty breathing \u2013 is present, do you notice any other physical sensations accompanying it? For example, do you experience muscle tension anywhere in your body \u2013 perhaps in your shoulders, neck, or jaw? And do you notice any changes in your heart rate \u2013 a racing heart, palpitations, or a feeling of your heart skipping beats?"

It\u2019s a very specific experience, and I appreciate you taking the time to describe it so thoroughly. \n\nLet\u2019s focus on the muscle tension. When you notice this tightness and muscle tension, can you pinpoint *what* you\u2019re thinking or feeling *about* when you notice it? Let\u2019s use what we call the \u201claddering technique.\u201d So, let\u2019s start with a relatively simple situation \u2013 for example, when you\u2019re reading and this feeling suddenly appears. What is that you *don\u2019t* like about this situation and *why*?"

It feels like I\u2019m not understanding them, and that\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. It makes me feel\u2026 inadequate, I suppose. Like I\u2019m supposed to *get* it, and I don't.\n\n(He shifts slightly in his chair.)\n\nIs that\u2026 is that a reasonable starting point?"

The feeling of not understanding and the associated sense of inadequacy \u2013 that\u2019s a really important piece of information. \n\nLet\u2019s dig into that feeling of inadequacy. When you say you feel \"supposed to get it,\" what does that \"supposed to\" represent? What do you believe *should* be happening for you to feel comfortable and confident in these situations \u2013 like when you're reading? What would it *need* to be for you to feel more okay?"

It\u2019s almost as if there\u2019s a judgment being made *by you* about your ability to understand, and that judgment is triggering these physical sensations. \n\nLet's try this: Can you think of a time in your life \u2013 not necessarily a recent one \u2013 when you felt particularly criticized or evaluated, perhaps by a parent, teacher, or someone else who held a high standard for you? It doesn't have to be a major event, just a situation where you felt a sense of being held to a high expectation. What was that experience like for you?"

    "role": "therapist",

It sounds like that experience \u2013 the feeling of being judged and held to a high standard \u2013 has had a significant impact on how you perceive yourself and your abilities. Thank you for sharing that.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the *feeling* of that judgment. When you recall that experience \u2013 let\u2019s call it \u201cthe experience\u201d for now \u2013 what was the *core* feeling you experienced *during* that time? Was it shame, fear, disappointment, or something else entirely? And on a scale of 1 to 10, how intense was that core feeling? It\u2019s okay if it\u2019s a difficult question, and it\u2019s perfectly alright if you can\u2019t pinpoint it exactly \u2013 just try to describe the *quality* of the feeling."

    "content": "(Nodding understandingly) Thank you for that reflection, Elias. It takes a lot of courage to revisit those earlier experiences, and I appreciate you sharing that with such honesty.\n\nLet\u2019s hold onto that feeling for a moment. When you recall \"the experience,\" can you describe the *color* of that feeling? I know that sounds a little unusual, but I'm interested in the sensory aspect of it. Was it a bright, sharp color, a muted color, or perhaps something else entirely? And if you could give that feeling a name \u2013 a single word \u2013 what would it be?"

When you access that feeling \u2013 the one you've described as\u2026 let\u2019s say a \u201cmuted grey\u201d \u2013 what's the *texture* of it like?

It\u2019s a powerful image, and it speaks volumes about the challenges you\u2019re facing. \n\nNow, let's shift our focus slightly. We\u2019ve identified this \u201cmuted grey\u201d \u2013 this feeling of being trapped \u2013 as a key component of your experience.

When you notice this \u201cmuted grey\u201d surfacing, what\u2019s the *first* thing you tend to do? Do you try to distract yourself \u2013 perhaps with an activity, a conversation, or something else? Do you try to suppress the feeling \u2013 to push it away?

When you\u2019re distracted \u2013 perhaps by reading, watching TV, or engaging in a conversation \u2013 how effective is that distraction in the *long term*? Does it truly resolve the underlying feeling, or does it simply postpone it, perhaps making it feel even stronger when it eventually resurfaces? And if it doesn\u2019t resolve it, what happens *after* the distraction ends?"
