Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This can be a sign that your grief is affecting not just your emotional well-being, but also your daily life and relationships.\n\nWhen you think about going through your mom's belongings or looking at photos of her, what specifically feels too hard or painful?

I just feel like they don't understand what I'm going through, and it's hard for me to explain how I'm feeling. I've been canceling plans or making excuses not to hang out, which I know isn't fair to them. It's just that being around others feels like too much effort right now, and I'd rather just be alone.

It's like you're trying to protect yourself from feeling too much pain or sadness all at once.

Grief is a journey, and everyone experiences it differently. It might be helpful to remind yourself that you don't have to go through this alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to support you.\n\nLet's try to break down some of these fears and worries together.

Would it be feeling embarrassed or vulnerable, or something else entirely?"

Maybe I'll be able to think about my mom without feeling this overwhelming sadness all the time. I don't know, maybe I'm just waiting for some kind of acceptance or understanding of what's happened.\n\nI think the worst that could happen if I started talking about my feelings is that I would break down and not be able to stop crying.

Grief is exhausting, both emotionally and physically. It's normal to feel like you're running on empty and that even simple tasks feel like too much.\n\nIt might be helpful to think about what you need right now to feel supported and comforted. Is there someone in your life who you feel like you can talk to without feeling judged or pitied? Maybe a trusted friend, family member, or therapist? Sometimes just having someone to listen and validate our feelings can make a big difference.\n\nI also want to explore this idea of being a burden to others. What do you think would happen if you did start talking about your feelings with someone else? Do you think they would be overwhelmed or unable to handle it, or is there something else that's driving this fear?\n\nIt might be helpful to remind yourself that people who care about you want to support you and help you through this difficult time. They may not have all the answers, but sometimes just having someone to listen and be present with can make a big difference.\n\nIn terms of your fatigue, it might be helpful to think about what self-care activities you can do to help manage your energy levels. Are there things that normally bring you comfort and relaxation, like reading, taking a bath, or listening to music? Sometimes engaging in these activities can help us feel more grounded and calm.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take your time processing your emotions. Grief is a journey, and everyone experiences it differently. It might be helpful to remind yourself that you don't have to go through this alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to support you.\n\nLet's try to break down some of these fears and worries together. What do you think is one small step you could take this week to start talking about your feelings with someone else? Could you send a text to a friend or family member, or make a phone call to a therapist? Sometimes taking that first step can be the hardest part, but it can also be a really powerful way to start feeling more supported and connected."

Just having someone to listen might make me feel a bit more supported.\n\nAnd yeah, self-care is something I've been neglecting lately. I used to love reading and taking long baths, but lately, I just haven't had the energy for it. Maybe I can try to make some time for those things this week, even if it's just 10 or 15 minutes a day.\n\nIt's funny, talking about all of this has made me realize that I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to \"get over\" my grief quickly. Like, I feel like I should be farther along in the process by now, but hearing you say that it's okay to take my time and that everyone experiences grief differently has really helped me feel more at ease.\n\nI think what I need to remember is that it's okay to not have all the answers right now, and that it's okay to ask for help when I need it. Just knowing that I have people like you to talk to, and that my sister is there for me, makes me feel a bit more hopeful about getting through this tough time.\n\nThanks for listening and offering such kind words. It really means a lot to me."
