Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

When you say \"everything\" is on your mind, are there any specific areas of your life that feel particularly overwhelming, such as work, relationships, or daily responsibilities?

Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you didn't get all these little things done perfectly? For example, what's the worst that could happen if you're a few days late paying a bill, or if the house isn't spotless? What's driving that need for perfection in these areas?"

Can you tell me more about what you think your mom would say if she knew you were feeling this way? Would she want you to be putting so much pressure on yourself, or would she want you to prioritize your own well-being too?"

You're feeling irritable, snappy, and like you're walking on eggshells, waiting for the next thing to trigger your frustration.\n\nLet's try to explore this idea of \"not doing enough\" a bit further. What does \"enough\" mean to you? Is it about achieving a certain standard, meeting someone else's expectations, or something else entirely? What would need to happen for you to feel like you're doing \"enough\"?"

Grief and stress can affect our cognitive function, making it harder to concentrate and stay focused. It's not uncommon for people to experience brain fog or feeling like they're in a daze after losing someone close to them.\n\nCan you tell me more about what happens when your mind starts wandering?

When you say your mind \"drifts off,\" do you find yourself thinking about specific worries or concerns, like things you need to do or problems you're trying to solve? Or is it more of a blank, spaced-out feeling, where you're not really thinking about anything in particular?\n\nAlso, have you noticed any patterns or triggers that might contribute to these episodes of mental fogginess?

Like, if I'm going through her old things or looking at photos, it can be really overwhelming and my mind will start to feel foggy. But it's not just those things... sometimes it can happen out of the blue, even when I'm doing something routine like grocery shopping or cooking dinner. *looks down, fidgeting slightly* Does that make sense?"

It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of emotional and cognitive overload, where your mind is trying to process a lot of different emotions and thoughts at once. The fact that it happens more often when you're alone or doing things that remind you of your mom suggests that there's a strong emotional component to this.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention it can happen out of the blue, even during routine activities. This might suggest that there's a kind of \"emotional background noise\" going on, where your mind is always working in the background to process and deal with your emotions, even when you're not consciously thinking about them.\n\nI want to explore this idea of emotional overload further. Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you're going through your mom's old things or looking at photos? What specific emotions come up for you, and how do you try to cope with them? Is it a feeling of sadness, nostalgia, guilt, or something else entirely?"

When I'm going through her old things, it's like I'm seeing her everywhere, you know? Her handwriting on old notes, her favorite books, her perfume... it's all just so familiar and comforting, but also really painful.\n\nI guess the emotions that come up for me are mostly sadness and nostalgia. I miss her so much, and it feels like a part of me is gone. But there's also some guilt, I think. Guilt for not being able to take care of her more, or for not spending enough time with her when she was alive. And sometimes, there's even some anger, just because it's not fair that she's gone and I'm left to deal with all this stuff on my own.\n\nAs for coping... *shrugs* I don't know, really. I try to just take things one step at a time, and focus on the present moment. But it's hard when everything feels so overwhelming. Sometimes I'll just put things away and try not to think about them, but that doesn't really work in the long run. Other times, I'll try to talk to friends or family members about how I'm feeling, but it's hard to put into words.\n\n*looks down, fidgeting slightly* Sorry, I don't know if this is making any sense. It's just all really complicated and emotional, you know?"

These are all normal feelings after losing someone close to you, especially when you're going through their belongings and memories. It's like you're reliving the past and confronting your emotions all over again.\n\nI want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and not know how to cope. Grief is a process, and it takes time to work through these emotions. It's also important to recognize that you don't have to do this alone.

It's all the little moments too - like when I would hurry her along when she was talking, or when I wouldn't call her as often as I should have. *sighs* It's just a lot of regret, I guess.\n\n*pauses, looking up* But at the same time, I know that my mom loved me and knew that I did the best I could with what I had. She was always so supportive and understanding... *smiles slightly* I remember this one time, she told me that she was proud of me, no matter what. And that's stuck with me.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that it's hard for me to reconcile the guilt and regret with the knowledge that my mom loved and accepted me for who I am. *looks down again* Does that make sense?"
