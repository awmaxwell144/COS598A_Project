    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, irritability, excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and somatic complaints (like stomach discomfort or headaches). This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

I'm here to provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to explore your thoughts and feelings. Please know that everything discussed in this session will remain confidential.\n\nI want to start by acknowledging that it takes courage to seek help, and I appreciate the trust you're placing in me. As we begin, I'd like to ask: What's been making you feel anxious or uneasy lately? Is there something specific that's been on your mind, or perhaps a situation that's causing you distress?"

It sounds like you're experiencing some restless feelings, which can be a common response to grief. This excess energy you're feeling might be related to anxiety or nervousness.

I'm here to listen and help you make sense of things, even if it feels like your thoughts are all jumbled up.\n\nLet's try to break it down a bit. When you say your mind is \"racing,\" what does that feel like? Is it more like worrying thoughts, memories popping up, or just a general feeling of being \"on edge\"? And when you pace around the room, do you feel like you're trying to escape from these thoughts, or is it more like you're trying to burn off some of this excess energy?"

It's okay to feel uncomfortable, and it's okay to not have all the words right now.\n\nWhen you're ready, I'd like to explore this a bit further. You mentioned that sometimes you'll be thinking about something random, and then suddenly your mind jumps to thoughts of your mom. What is it about those thoughts of your mom that feel particularly difficult or overwhelming for you? Is it the sadness of missing her, guilt about something, or perhaps worries about how you'll move forward without her?"

Can you tell me more about when these headaches started? Was it around the time your mom passed away, or have you been experiencing them for a while before that? And how would you describe the severity of these headaches - are they mild, moderate, or severe?"

Sometimes it feels like my head is going to explode. *looks down, fidgeting with hands again* But it's not just the headaches. I've been having trouble sleeping too. I'll lie in bed for hours and just can't seem to... relax, I suppose. My body feels all tense and tight, like I'm waiting for something to happen or something. *trails off, looking uncertain*"

It's like your body is responding to the stress and anxiety by becoming super vigilant, making it hard to wind down and rest.\n\nCan you tell me more about what goes through your mind when you're lying in bed, trying to sleep? Are there specific thoughts or worries that keep you awake, or is it more of a general feeling of unease or restlessness? And do you find yourself avoiding certain activities or situations during the day because they might trigger these feelings of tension or anxiety?"

And sometimes I'll be doing something, like cooking or watching TV, and I'll think about calling her to tell her about it, and then I remember that I can't. *pauses, looking uncomfortable* It's just little things like that which catch me off guard and make me feel... uneasy, I guess."

It's completely understandable that you'd want to avoid those feelings, but at the same time, avoiding them can also prolong the grieving process.\n\nI want to acknowledge how brave you're being by sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage to confront these difficult emotions. Can you tell me more about what you think would happen if you were to go to your mom's house? What are you most afraid of feeling or experiencing when you're there? Is it the sadness, the emptiness, or something else entirely?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of \"little things\" that catch you off guard. Are there any specific memories or associations that come up for you when you think about calling your mom or doing everyday activities without her? For example, do you remember specific conversations or moments you shared with her while cooking or watching TV together?"

It's like you're carrying a heavy weight around with you all the time, and it's exhausting.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you think is contributing to this feeling of exhaustion? Is it the constant thinking about your mom, the pressure to keep up with daily responsibilities, or something else entirely? And when you say that your mind is tired, what do you mean by that? Is it like you're struggling to focus, or are you feeling overwhelmed by your thoughts and emotions?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of \"overwhelmed by everything.\" What does that mean for you?

It's hard to focus on anything else when it feels like a part of me is missing. *pauses* Sorry, I don't know if that makes sense. It's just really hard to explain."

It's like you're trying to navigate a new reality without your mom, and everything feels uncertain and difficult.\n\nI want to acknowledge the pain and sadness you're feeling. It's okay to feel like a part of you is missing, because in many ways, it is. Your mom was a significant presence in your life, and her absence leaves a gaping hole that can't be filled easily.\n\nIt takes a lot of courage to admit when we're struggling, and I'm proud of you for being honest about how you're feeling. It's okay to not have all the answers right now, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.\n\nLet's take a step back and try to break this down together. What do you think would help you feel more grounded and focused in your daily life? Would it be helpful to establish a routine or schedule that gives you a sense of structure and normalcy? Or perhaps we could explore some coping mechanisms, such as journaling or talking to friends and family, to help you process your emotions?\n\nAlso, I want to gently explore this idea of wondering what your mom would say or do in certain situations. What do you think she would want for you right now? Would she want you to be happy, to take care of yourself, or to focus on your well-being? Sometimes, thinking about what our loved ones would want for us can give us a sense of guidance and direction."

It's like your body is trying to tell you something, but in a way that's not always easy to understand.\n\nIt makes perfect sense that you'd feel queasy or uncomfortable when thinking about food, especially if eating reminds you of your mom or triggers emotions related to her loss.

Was it around the time your mom passed away, or have you been experiencing them for a while before that? And are there any specific situations or triggers that seem to make your stomach symptoms worse?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of your body reacting to emotional stress.

It just feels really empty and sad without her there. *pauses, taking a deep breath* And as for other physical symptoms... I don't know, I just feel really irritable all the time, I guess. Little things that wouldn't normally bother me are just getting on my nerves, and I find myself snapping at people or feeling really short-tempered.
