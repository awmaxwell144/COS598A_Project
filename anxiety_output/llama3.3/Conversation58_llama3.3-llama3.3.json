    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, irritability, excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and somatic complaints (like stomach discomfort or headaches). This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

I want to assure you that our conversation will be a safe, non-judgmental space for you to express yourself.\n\nWhat's been making you feel anxious or uneasy lately?

What specifically feels different, and is there something in particular that's causing you the most discomfort or worry?"

It's possible that your body is reacting to the emotional changes you're going through.\n\nCan you help me understand what you mean by \"getting to you\"? How are these physical symptoms affecting your daily life, and what's the worst part about experiencing them?

When these thoughts pop up, are they mostly about your mom, or are they more general worries about the future, daily life, or something else?

It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and we can come back to this conversation when you're ready.\n\nLet's take a deep breath together and shift gears for a moment.

Is it like the park doesn't feel as enjoyable or peaceful anymore, or is there something specific that's missing for you when you're there without her?

That feeling of emptiness is a testament to the depth of your love and connection with her.\n\nI want to explore this idea further - what do you think would happen if you were to allow yourself to fully feel that emptiness, to acknowledge the pain of her absence? Would it be unbearable, or might it potentially lead to some kind of healing or acceptance? What is it about feeling that emptiness that scares you or makes you uncomfortable?"

It's like a part of me is gone, and I don't know how to fill that void.\n\n*pauses, taking a deep breath* As for allowing myself to feel my emotions more deeply... I guess I'm afraid that it'll be too much to handle. That I'll break down or lose control somehow.

It's like I'm stuck in this limbo, and I don't know how to move forward.\n\n*looks up, eyes searching for reassurance* Do you think it's possible to find a way to feel my emotions without getting overwhelmed? To find a way to process my grief and move forward, without losing myself in the sadness?"
