Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

And as for energy levels... *sighs* Let's just say I'm running on fumes most of the time.\n\nAs for social activities, I've been avoiding them, to be honest.

It sounds like she played a big role in helping you find meaning and purpose in your life. Now that she's gone, it's like you're having to rediscover those things for yourself, and that can be a really challenging and overwhelming process.\n\nI want to acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay right now. It's okay to feel exhausted, overwhelmed, and unsure of what to do next. But I also want to encourage you to take small steps towards taking care of yourself, even if it feels like a struggle. That might mean getting out of bed a little earlier each day, or taking a short walk outside, or eating a nourishing meal. It might mean reaching out to a friend or family member for support, or engaging in an activity that brings you comfort and joy.\n\nIn terms of your social activities and work, it's completely understandable that you're struggling to focus and motivate yourself right now.

You mentioned that your stomach has been bothering you, and that you've been experiencing headaches and tension. Can you tell me more about when these symptoms started, and how they've been affecting your daily life?

Many people who have experienced a significant loss feel like they're just going through the motions, and that it's hard to find meaning or purpose in their lives.\n\nIn terms of your work, it might be helpful to talk to your employer or HR department about taking some time off or adjusting your workload. Sometimes, taking a step back and giving yourself permission to grieve can be really helpful.\n\nAs for putting on a happy face, I want to challenge that idea a bit. What if, instead of trying to pretend like everything is okay, you allowed yourself to be vulnerable and honest with others? What if you told them that you're struggling, and that you need their support and understanding? Sometimes, being open and honest about our emotions can be really liberating, and it can help us build deeper connections with others.\n\nIn terms of your physical symptoms, it's possible that they're related to your grief and stress.

Sometimes, getting professional help can be really helpful in managing our emotions and finding ways to cope with difficult situations.\n\nFinally, I want to leave you with a question: what do you think your mom would want for you right now?

What do you think she would say to you if she were here?\n\nAnd one more thing: can you tell me about any avoidance behaviors you may have been engaging in since your mom's passing? Are there any activities, places, or people that you've been avoiding because they remind you of her or make you feel uncomfortable?"

I haven't gone back to our favorite coffee shop since she passed away, because it reminds me too much of her.

We don't always see eye-to-eye, and I don't want to burden him with my emotions. But at the same time, I feel like I need to talk to someone about this, and he's the only family member I have left. *sighs* It's all just really complicated and hard to navigate.\n\n*looks down again, fidgeting with hands* Sorry, I'm just really struggling to cope with all of this.

It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and struggling to cope with your emotions, and that's completely understandable.\n\nI want to acknowledge that it's okay to avoid certain things or places that remind you of your mom. It's a natural part of the grieving process, and it doesn't mean that you're not dealing with your emotions. Sometimes, taking a break from things that trigger strong emotions can be helpful in allowing us to recharge and come back to them when we're feeling more resilient.\n\nIt's also understandable that you're hesitant to talk to your dad about how you're feeling. It can be challenging to navigate complex family relationships, especially during difficult times. However, it might be helpful to consider reaching out to him or another trusted family member or friend for support. Sometimes, talking through our emotions with someone who cares about us can be really helpful in processing and healing.\n\nI want to remind you that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people who have experienced a significant loss feel like they're just trying to survive from one day to the next. But I also want to encourage you to take small steps towards taking care of yourself, even if it feels like a struggle. That might mean doing something creative, going for a walk, or practicing some relaxation techniques.\n\nIn terms of your relationship with your dad, it might be helpful to consider having an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. It's possible that he's struggling with his own emotions and could benefit from talking through them with you. Remember that you don't have to go through this alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you.\n\nFinally, I want to leave you with a question: what do you think is the smallest step you could take today to start taking care of yourself? Is there something that you've been putting off or avoiding that you could tackle in a small way? Sometimes, taking tiny steps towards self-care can be really powerful in helping us build momentum and feel more empowered.\n\nAnd one more thing: I want to encourage you to practice some self-compassion. Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and that you're doing the best you can under difficult circumstances. Be gentle with yourself, and try to reframe any negative self-talk or criticism. You are strong, capable, and resilient, and you will get through this difficult time."

It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders just talking about all of this. I think the smallest step I could take today to start taking care of myself would be to go for a walk outside. I've been cooped up in my apartment for days, and some fresh air might do me some good. And maybe, just maybe, I'll try to reach out to my dad later and see if we can talk about how I'm feeling. It's scary, but it feels like it might be an important step in healing.\n\n*takes a deep breath* You know, I think I've been so focused on trying to be strong and hold everything together that I forgot it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel sad and scared and overwhelmed. And it's okay to ask for help. *smiles slightly* Thank you for reminding me of that.\n\n*pauses, collecting thoughts* I think I'll also try to practice some self-compassion, like you suggested. It's hard for me to be kind to myself when I'm feeling down, but I know it's important. Maybe I'll write myself a letter or something, just to remind myself that I'm doing the best I can and that it's okay to make mistakes.\n\n*looks up, eyes shining with tears* Thank you again for listening and supporting me.
