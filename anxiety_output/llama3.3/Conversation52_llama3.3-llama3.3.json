    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, irritability, excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and somatic complaints (like stomach discomfort or headaches). This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

That can be really frustrating and exhausting.\n\nLet's try to break it down a bit more. When you say your brain won't \"turn off,\" what do you mean by that? Are you having trouble quieting your mind, or are you getting caught up in specific thoughts or worries that keep you awake? For example, are you replaying the project situation over and over, or are you worrying about something else entirely?"

When you say your stomach feels \"tight,\" how often would you say you experience that sensation? Is it constant, or does it come and go? And are there any specific situations or thoughts that seem to trigger it, or make it worse? For example, do you notice it more when you're thinking about work, or when you're in certain environments?"

When you say that the knot in your stomach goes away when you're doing something that takes your mind off it, what do you think is happening there? Is it that you're distracting yourself from worrisome thoughts, or is it that you feel more connected to others and less alone when you're with friends or engaged in activities? What is it about being alone or thinking about work that makes the stomach tension worse? Is it a fear of failure, fear of not meeting expectations, or something else entirely?"

The fear of making mistakes or not meeting expectations can be really overwhelming.\n\nI want to explore this sense of \"walking on eggshells\" further. What do you think would happen if something did go wrong? Would it be a catastrophic failure, or is it more that you're afraid of your boss's reaction or disappointment? Is there a specific outcome or consequence that you're trying to avoid?\n\nAlso, when you say you feel like you're not doing a good job, what does that mean to you?

When you say that little things are setting you off, is it possible that these small annoyances are somehow related to the bigger stressors in your life, like work or feelings of inadequacy? Are you feeling like you're losing control or feeling overwhelmed by all the things that are piling up?\n\nAlso, when you snap at people, what happens afterwards?

It's great that you're recognizing the impact your behavior is having on those around you and wanting to make changes.\n\nLet's explore this idea of feeling like people are going to start avoiding you or thinking you're a jerk all the time. What do you think would happen if that actually did occur? Would it be a complete loss of friendships and relationships, or would it be more of a temporary setback? And what does being seen as a \"jerk\" mean to you, exactly? Is it a fear of being rejected or unliked, or is there something deeper going on?\n\nAlso, when your friends comment on your short temper, how do you respond to them? Do you get defensive, or are you able to listen to their concerns and have an open conversation about what's going on? Are there any specific relationships that you're worried about damaging due to your current emotional state?"

What do you think is draining your energy? Is it the constant worrying about work, the stress of everyday life, or something else entirely? Are there any specific activities or situations that leave you feeling more exhausted than others?\n\nAlso, when you say you feel like you're \"running on empty,\" what does that mean to you? Is it a sense of being completely depleted, or is it more like you're just going through the motions without any sense of purpose or fulfillment?

When you say your mind keeps wandering, what kind of thoughts are you typically getting distracted by? Are they worries about work, personal concerns, or something else entirely?

For example, do you find that you're more foggy in the mornings or afternoons? Are there certain environments or situations that seem to exacerbate your symptoms?\n\nLastly, what do you think would need to happen for you to feel like your brain is \"clear\" again?

Work, my future, relationships... it's like my brain is constantly trying to problem-solve and anticipate what could go wrong.

It's not that I'm lazy or unmotivated, it's just that my brain feels like it's already at capacity, you know?\n\nAs for patterns or triggers, I've noticed that I tend to feel more foggy when I'm under a lot of pressure or have a tight deadline looming.

I'm not really sure. I guess I just wish I could find a way to quiet my mind and focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in all these worries about the future or regrets about the past. Does that make sense?"
