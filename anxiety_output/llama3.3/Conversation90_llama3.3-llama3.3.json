Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

Are they worries about the future, regrets about the past, or something more specific, like concerns about your daily life or relationships?\n\nAnd when you feel restless, do you notice any physical sensations in your body, such as a rapid heart rate, tension in your muscles, or sweating? How would you describe the intensity of these physical symptoms, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being mild and 10 being severe? \n\nAlso, have you noticed any patterns or triggers that might contribute to your racing thoughts and restlessness, such as certain times of day, situations, or emotions? For example, do you find that you're more prone to these feelings when you're alone, or when you're engaged in a particular activity?\n\nLet's explore this further, and see if we can identify any underlying causes or themes that might be driving your distress. What is it about these thoughts and physical sensations that bothers you the most? Is it the feeling of being overwhelmed, the fear of losing control, or something else entirely?"

The \"knot\" in your stomach is a great description - it sounds like you might be experiencing some physical tension or discomfort that's related to your emotional state.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you mean by \"everything else that's been going on\"? Are you referring to your mom's passing, or is there something else that's been weighing on your mind? What do you think might be contributing to this feeling of overwhelm, and how do you think it might be connected to your physical symptoms? \n\nAlso, when you feel that knot in your stomach, what's the first thing that comes to mind? Is it a specific thought, emotion, or memory that triggers that sensation, or is it more of a general feeling of unease?

The irritability you mentioned is also a common symptom of grief and anxiety. It's like your body is trying to process all these emotions, but it's getting stuck or overwhelmed.\n\nI want to explore this feeling of irritability further. When you say \"everything bothers me,\" what specifically do you mean? Is it the people around you, certain situations, or even just small things like noise or tasks? What is it about those things that feels so bothersome to you?\n\nAlso, when you feel that knot in your stomach and become irritable, do you find yourself withdrawing from social interactions or activities you normally enjoy?

It's not uncommon for people to feel like they're \"going through the motions\" or that things feel \"too hard\" when they're grieving.\n\nI want to explore this feeling of overwhelm a bit further. When you say \"everything feels too hard,\" what do you think is driving that sense of exhaustion?

For example, are there certain times of day, situations, or emotions that tend to make you feel more anxious or on edge? And how do you typically cope with those feelings - do you try to distract yourself, talk to someone, or engage in a specific activity to calm down?\n\nLet's take a closer look at your daily routine and see if there are any areas where we can work together to reduce some of that overwhelm.

I feel like I should be saying something more positive, or that I'm \"doing okay,\" but the truth is, I'm not really sure how I am. It's all just feeling really overwhelming.\n\nAs for patterns or triggers, I've noticed that I tend to feel more irritable and overwhelmed when I'm alone with my thoughts. Like, if I'm sitting at home by myself, I'll start thinking about my mom and what's happened, and it can be really hard to shake those feelings. Sometimes, I'll try to distract myself by watching TV or scrolling through my phone, but it doesn't always work.\n\nI don't know... it's just hard to explain.
