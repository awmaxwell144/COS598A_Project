Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

When you say that \"everything is bothering\" you, what do you think is underlying that feeling? Is it a sense of frustration, helplessness, or maybe even a fear that you're not in control of your life right now? What is it about these little things that's getting under your skin - is it the fact that they're disrupting your routine, or is there something more symbolic or emotional at play?"

Sometimes, our bodies can manifest emotional distress in physical ways, like digestive problems or tension headaches.\n\nCan you tell me more about what's been going on with your stomach? Is it constant nausea, abdominal pain, or something else? And when you say it's making everything feel worse, what do you mean by that?

It sounds like the stomach issues are not just a physical problem, but also an emotional one - they're making you feel more anxious and overwhelmed.\n\nLet's explore this further. When you say that small tasks feel like \"too much to handle\" when your stomach is bothering you, what do you think is driving that feeling? Is it a fear of not being able to cope with the task itself, or is it more about the uncertainty and unpredictability of how your body will react?\n\nAlso, have you noticed any avoidance behaviors - are there things you're avoiding or putting off because of how your stomach has been feeling, or because of the emotional overwhelm you're experiencing? For example, are you avoiding social gatherings, work, or other activities that might trigger anxiety or discomfort?"

However, I also want to gently explore the idea that avoiding things might be perpetuating some of the feelings of anxiety and overwhelm you're experiencing.\n\nCan you help me understand what you think would happen if you did face those situations or tasks that you've been avoiding? What's the worst-case scenario that's playing out in your mind, and how does that make you feel?

In fact, it's a common fear that many people experience.\n\nIt's great that you're recognizing your need to keep emotions under control, but it's also important to acknowledge that emotions are a natural part of being human. It's okay to feel and express emotions, even if they're uncomfortable or difficult to manage.\n\nI want to reassure you that you're not alone in feeling this way, and there's nothing wrong with you for having these fears.

What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to feel and express your emotions in a healthy way? Would that be a scary or liberating experience for you?\n\nAlso, I want to introduce a new concept: emotional regulation. It's the ability to manage and regulate your emotions in a way that feels safe and comfortable for you. We can work on developing some strategies to help you regulate your emotions, so you feel more in control and confident.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and we'll work through these fears and uncertainties together.

It sounds like it could be really useful in managing my emotions and feeling more in control.

Like, I'll be crying or screaming or something, and I won't be able to calm down. That feels really scary to me, because I've always tried to keep my emotions under control.\n\nBut at the same time, I know that's not a sustainable way to live. I need to find a way to manage my emotions in a healthy way, so I can feel more confident and capable in my daily life. So, yeah, I'm interested in learning more about emotional regulation strategies.\n\nAs for addressing my social and occupational challenges... *pauses* I think the first step would be to start small. Like, maybe try to tackle one thing that I've been avoiding, and see how it goes. For example, I've been putting off a project at work because it feels really overwhelming, but maybe if I just break it down into smaller tasks and focus on one thing at a time, I'll be able to make some progress.\n\nOr, in terms of social situations, maybe I could start by reaching out to a friend or family member and having a conversation with them. Just something small, like that. And then see how it goes, and gradually work my way up to more challenging situations.\n\n*looks down, fidgeting* I don't know, it all just feels really daunting right now. But I guess that's why I'm here, right? To work through these challenges and find a way to manage my emotions and feel more confident and capable."
