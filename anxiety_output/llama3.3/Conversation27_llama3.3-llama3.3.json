Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

Those middle-of-the-night wake-ups and uncomfortable dreams can be really unsettling.\n\nLet's try to explore this further. When you wake up in the middle of the night, what's going through your mind? Are you thinking about the layoff at work, or is it something else entirely?

It's okay to not be okay, and I'm here to support you through this.\n\nLet's try to break this down further. When you say \"everything is piling up,\" what do you mean by that? Is it specifically related to work, or are there other areas of your life that are feeling overwhelming as well?

It's not just about getting more rest or sleep; it's about addressing the underlying emotional and mental exhaustion that's contributing to your fatigue.\n\nCan you help me understand what you think might be causing this feeling of being \"drained\" all the time? Is it related to the layoff at work, or are there other factors in your life that might be contributing to this sense of exhaustion? For example, are you putting a lot of pressure on yourself to perform or achieve certain things, or is there something else going on that's making you feel like you're running on empty?"

It doesn't mean you're not capable or competent; it just means your mind is preoccupied with other things right now.\n\nLet's try to explore this further. When your mind starts to wander, where does it tend to go? Does it get caught up in worries about the future, regrets about the past, or something else entirely? Are there any specific thoughts or themes that keep popping up and distracting you from the task at hand?\n\nAlso, have you noticed any avoidance behaviors or patterns where you might be putting off certain tasks or activities because they feel overwhelming or too stressful?

And I've also been avoiding talking to some of my coworkers because it feels too awkward after the layoff.

This can be a really tough pattern to break, but recognizing it is a huge first step.\n\nI want to explore this idea of \"what might happen\" if you were to face these avoided tasks or situations. What's the worst-case scenario that comes to mind when you think about checking your work email or talking to your coworkers? Is it fear of bad news, fear of being judged or evaluated, or something else entirely?\n\nAlso, what do you think would happen if you were able to confront and overcome these avoidance behaviors?

It's like I'm stuck in this limbo where I don't know how to move forward.\n\nI guess if I could overcome these avoidance behaviors... I might feel more in control of my life and my job. I'd be able to face challenges head-on instead of letting them build up and cause more anxiety. But it's hard for me to imagine what that would look like, or how I would even get there.

It's natural to want to protect yourself from potential stress and discomfort.\n\nHowever, I also want to gently encourage you to consider the possibility that avoiding these tasks and situations might not be the most effective long-term solution. By avoiding them, you might be inadvertently perpetuating your feelings of anxiety and overwhelm, rather than finding ways to manage and overcome them.\n\nLet's try to break this down further. What do you think is the underlying fear or concern that's driving your avoidance behaviors? Is it a fear of failure, a fear of being overwhelmed, or something else entirely? And what would need to happen for you to feel more confident and capable of facing these challenges head-on?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of \"being in control\" that you mentioned earlier.

But right now, everything feels so uncertain and overwhelming that I don't even know where to start.\n\nI'm not sure what would need to happen for me to feel more confident and capable of facing these challenges head-on. I guess I would need to feel like I have a better understanding of what's going on and what's expected of me.
