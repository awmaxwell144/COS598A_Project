Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

You're describing a sense of self-efficacy and confidence that came from being engaged in your work and having a clear direction. It's like you had a strong sense of foundation, and now that's been shaken.\n\nLosing a sense of identity can be a really challenging experience, especially when it's tied to something as significant as your job. It's like you're navigating unfamiliar terrain, trying to figure out who you are and what you want outside of that role.\n\nI want you to know that it's okay to feel this way, and it's normal for your sense of identity to evolve over time. We can work together to explore what this new chapter in your life might look like, and how you can start to rebuild your sense of self and confidence.\n\nTrusting yourself is a great place to start. That means developing a sense of self-compassion, acknowledging that it's okay to not have all the answers, and learning to make decisions that align with your values and goals. We can work on building those skills together.\n\nBefore we move forward, I want to acknowledge how brave you're being in sharing your fears and uncertainties with me. It takes a lot of courage to be this vulnerable. *offers a gentle nod* You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nCan you tell me more about what you think would be the first step in rebuilding your sense of trust in yourself?

If I could just focus on one thing, like getting through the day or making a decision about something small, that might help me build some momentum.\n\nAnd maybe... maybe being kinder to myself would help too. I feel like I've been really hard on myself lately, expecting myself to have all the answers and to be able to handle everything on my own. But that's not realistic, is it? *looks up, seeking reassurance* It's okay to ask for help and to not know what I'm doing, right?\n\nI also think it would be helpful to try to reconnect with things that bring me joy and make me feel good about myself. Like, I used to love reading and hiking, but I haven't done those things in a while because I've been so focused on work and stress. If I could find ways to incorporate those things back into my life, maybe that would help me feel more like myself again. *smiles slightly, looking hopeful* Does that sound like a good place to start?"

    "content": "*nods enthusiastically, smiling warmly* Oh, absolutely! You're identifying some really important steps towards rebuilding your sense of self and confidence. Taking things one step at a time is a great way to break down overwhelming tasks into manageable chunks, and being kinder to yourself is essential for developing a more compassionate and realistic mindset.\n\nIt's wonderful that you're recognizing the importance of self-care and reconnecting with activities that bring you joy. Reading and hiking can be great ways to clear your mind, boost your mood, and help you feel more grounded. By incorporating these activities back into your life, you may find that you're better able to cope with stress and uncertainty.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help and to not have all the answers. In fact, it's a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you need support. *offers a reassuring nod* You don't have to go through this alone, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nAs we move forward, let's focus on building small moments of joy and self-care into your daily life. What if we start with something simple, like committing to read for 10-15 minutes each day or taking a short walk outside during your lunch break? Sometimes, it's these small, consistent actions that can help us build momentum and develop a greater sense of confidence and control.\n\nHow does that sound? Is there anything in particular that you'd like to focus on first, or any specific goals you'd like to set for yourself in the coming days or weeks?"

I'd also like to try to take a short walk outside during my lunch break, just to get some fresh air and stretch my legs.\n\nAs for specific goals, I think I'd like to focus on being kinder to myself and practicing self-compassion. It's easy for me to get caught up in negative self-talk and self-criticism, but I know that's not helpful. I'd like to work on developing a more gentle and supportive inner voice.\n\nI'd also like to explore ways to reconnect with my sense of purpose and identity outside of my job. Maybe we could brainstorm some ideas for hobbies or activities that might help me feel more fulfilled and engaged? *looks up, seeking guidance and support* What do you think would be a good way to start exploring this?"
