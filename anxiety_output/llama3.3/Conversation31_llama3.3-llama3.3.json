Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

I have over 8 years of experience working with individuals to address anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns. I want you to know that this is a safe and non-judgmental space for you to express yourself.\n\nI'm here to listen and support you, and I'm excited to work together to understand what's been troubling you. Can you tell me, what's been making you feel anxious or uneasy lately? What are some of the thoughts, feelings, or situations that have been on your mind and causing you distress?"

Losing a loved one can be incredibly difficult, and it's completely understandable that you're experiencing some challenging emotions and physical sensations right now.\n\nThe restlessness you're describing doesn't sound weird at all. It's actually a pretty common symptom of anxiety and grief. It's as if your body is trying to release some of the pent-up energy and tension that's been building up inside you.\n\nCan you tell me more about what happens when you start feeling this restlessness? For example, do you notice any other physical sensations, such as a racing heart, sweating, or tightness in your muscles? And are there any specific thoughts or worries that seem to trigger this feeling of restlessness, or does it seem to come out of nowhere?"

That can be really tough to deal with, especially when you feel like you should be able to relax and calm down.\n\nCan you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you start feeling restless and your thoughts start racing? Are you thinking about your mom, or is it more general worries or concerns that are on your mind? And what do you think would need to happen for you to feel like you can finally relax and quiet your thoughts?"

When you say your mind feels \"cluttered and overwhelmed,\" what do you think is contributing to that feeling? Is it specifically thoughts about your mom, or are there other worries or stressors in your life that are adding to that sense of overwhelm?\n\nAnd can you tell me more about what happens when you're lying in bed, trying to fall asleep?

It's like your body and mind are in a state of constant alertness, waiting for the other shoe to drop, so to speak.\n\nLet's try to break this down a bit further. When you say you feel like you're \"waiting for something to happen,\" what do you think might be driving that feeling? Is it fear of losing someone else, or fear of not being able to cope with your emotions, or something else entirely?\n\nAnd what do you think would need to happen for you to feel like you can finally relax and let your guard down?

Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that make them worse? For example, do they tend to happen at certain times of the day, or when you're in specific situations?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this feeling of being \"overwhelmed\" a bit further. What does that word mean to you? Is it like you're drowning in your emotions, or like you're carrying a heavy weight on your shoulders?

It's okay to feel overwhelmed and to need some space to yourself.\n\nCan you tell me more about what happens when you start feeling like you need to be left alone? Is it like you're feeling suffocated or trapped by the people around you, or is it more that you just don't have the emotional energy to engage with them right now?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of \"snapping at people for no reason.\" Are there any specific thoughts or feelings that come up for you in those moments?

It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

Who do you feel is expecting you to be okay? Is it family members, friends, or maybe even yourself? And what do you think would happen if you didn't meet those expectations? Would you feel like you're letting people down, or that you're not good enough?\n\nAlso, I want to ask, what do you think you need right now in order to start feeling better?

And then there's myself... I feel like I'm expecting too much from myself too. I keep thinking that I should be over this by now, that I should be able to move on and be happy again.\n\nIf I didn't meet those expectations... I don't know, it feels like I'd be letting everyone down. Like I'd be a disappointment to them, and to myself. It's a lot of pressure to deal with.\n\nAs for what I need right now... I think I just need someone to listen to me, without trying to fix everything or tell me that it's going to be okay. I need someone to just hear me, and understand how hard this is for me. And maybe some time to figure out who I am now, without my mom. Everything feels so different and uncertain, and I don't know how to navigate it all.\n\nBut at the same time... I'm not even sure if I'm ready to talk about all of this. It's still really hard for me to think about, and it feels like it's all going to come flooding back if I start talking about it too much.

I'm just going to sit with you in this uncertainty and help you explore your feelings and thoughts.\n\nIt's completely understandable that you're not sure if you're ready to talk about all of this yet. Grief is a process, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. We can go as slowly or as quickly as you need, and we can stop whenever you feel like you've had enough.\n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to explore the idea of self-compassion. What would you say to a friend who was going through something similar?

I would tell them that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and scared, and that they're not alone.\n\nBut when it comes to myself, I think I've been trying to be stronger than I actually am. I've been trying to push through my emotions and just \"get over\" my grief, instead of really allowing myself to feel it. It's like I'm afraid of being vulnerable or weak, but at the same time, I know that's not sustainable.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that I need to learn how to be more compassionate with myself, and to allow myself to feel my emotions without judgment.

It's amazing that you're recognizing this pattern in yourself and wanting to make a change.\n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to practice some self-compassion exercises. For example, you could try writing yourself a letter from the perspective of a compassionate friend. What would you say to yourself if you were trying to comfort a friend who was going through a similar experience?\n\nAlso, I want to ask, what do you think it would take for you to feel like you're being kind to yourself?

We can work through this together, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nBefore we move forward, I just want to check in with you and make sure that you're feeling comfortable with the pace of our conversation.

I don't want to shut down or avoid talking about this stuff, but I do need to take care of myself and make sure I'm not getting too overwhelmed. Does that sound okay?"
