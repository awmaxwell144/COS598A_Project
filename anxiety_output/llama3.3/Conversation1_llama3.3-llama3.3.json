Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

When you feel that surge of irritation, what do you think is underlying it? Is it just the frustration with the situation, or is there something else going on for you? For example, are you feeling overwhelmed, or like you're already at your limit, and then these small things just push you over the edge?\n\nAlso, I want to gently ask, do you think your mom's passing might be contributing to these feelings of irritability and frustration? Sometimes, grief can manifest in unexpected ways, such as increased irritability or anxiety. Is that something you've considered, or is there something else going on that you think might be driving these feelings?"

It takes time to figure things out and find a new sense of balance.\n\nRegarding your headaches, have you noticed if they're triggered by specific situations or emotions? For example, do you get them when you're feeling stressed or anxious, or when you're thinking about your mom?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of \"everything piling up\" further. What specifically is piling up for you? Is it just the practical responsibilities, like taking care of errands and chores, or is it also emotional, like feelings of grief and loss? Are there any specific thoughts or worries that are contributing to this sense of overwhelm?\n\nAnd one more thing: how are you taking care of yourself during this difficult time?

Is it fear, anxiety, or something else entirely? What are some of the thoughts or feelings that come up when you think about reaching out to friends or trying new things?\n\nAlso, I want to gently ask: have you considered talking to your friends or loved ones about how you're feeling?

It's clear that she was an incredibly supportive and encouraging presence in your life, and it's natural to feel like a part of you is missing without her.\n\n*leans forward slightly* I want to reassure you that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take the time you need to process your emotions. You don't have to pretend to be okay when you're not, and it's actually really brave of you to acknowledge your true feelings.\n\nRegarding your concerns about burdening others with your problems, I want to ask: what do you think would happen if you did reach out to friends or loved ones about how you're feeling? Do you think they would be understanding and supportive, or do you worry that they wouldn't know how to respond?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this idea of \"pretending to be okay\" further. What do you think it means to be \"okay\" in your eyes? Is it about putting on a brave face, or is it about truly feeling healed and whole again?

For some people, being okay might mean feeling happy and carefree all the time, while for others, it might mean simply being able to get through each day without feeling overwhelmed. What do you think it would take for you to feel like you're making progress in your healing journey?\n\nAlso, I want to ask: what are some things that you used to enjoy doing with your mom, or things that she encouraged you to try?

I feel like I'm just going through the motions most of the time. I've also been trying to eat healthier and get more sleep, but it's hard when my mind is racing all the time.\n\n*pauses, looking up* I think the most challenging part of my day is waking up in the morning.

Grief is a unique and individual experience, and there's no set timeline for when you should be feeling better. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to not be okay right now.\n\nI love that your mom encouraged you to prioritize your own well-being and not worry too much about what others think.

Sometimes, it's about showing up and being present, even when we don't feel like it. Those small steps can add up over time, and they can help you build momentum and find a sense of calm and comfort.\n\nI also want to acknowledge how hard it must be for you to wake up in the morning, feeling that wave of sadness and grief. It's like your heart is still adjusting to this new reality, and it's okay to feel that way. Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.\n\nThose little reminders of your mom throughout the day can be tough, but they can also be beautiful memories. It's like your heart is holding onto those moments, and that's okay. It's okay to feel nostalgic and sentimental, and it's okay to honor your mom's memory in whatever way feels authentic to you.\n\nAs for finding a sense of calm and comfort again, I absolutely believe it's possible. It might not be the same as it was before, but it can be different, and it can be just as beautiful. It's like your heart is being reshaped, and that takes time. Be patient with yourself, and remember that you're doing the best you can.\n\nYou don't have to learn to live without a sense of calm and comfort; instead, you can learn to find new ways to cultivate it.

Is there something specific that you've been wanting to try or explore, but haven't had the chance yet?\n\nAlso, I want to offer you a gentle suggestion: what if you tried to approach your day with a sense of curiosity instead of anxiety? What if you asked yourself, \"What will today bring?\" or \"What can I learn from this experience?\" Instead of waiting for something else to go wrong, what if you focused on finding small moments of beauty and joy throughout the day?\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and it's okay to not have all the answers right now. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Keep showing up, keep being present, and trust that you'll find your way through this difficult time."

I used to love writing in my journal when I was younger, but I haven't done it in a while. Maybe that could be a way for me to process my emotions and reflect on my experiences.\n\n*looks up* I like your suggestion about approaching the day with curiosity instead of anxiety. That makes sense. Instead of worrying about what might go wrong, I could try to focus on what might go right. And I could ask myself questions like \"What can I learn from this experience?\" or \"What opportunities might arise today?\"\n\n*smiles slightly* You know, it's funny. When my mom was alive, she always used to say that every day is a new chance to start again. She'd say that no matter what happened yesterday or last week, today is a fresh start. I think I need to remind myself of that more often.\n\n*pauses, looking down* But it's hard when everything feels so uncertain right now. I just wish I could fast forward to a time when I feel more stable and secure. When I'm not constantly worried about what might happen next.\n\n*looks up* Do you think that's normal? To feel like you're just trying to survive from one day to the next, instead of really living?"
