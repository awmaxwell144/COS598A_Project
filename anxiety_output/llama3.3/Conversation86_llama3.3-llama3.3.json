Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Are there specific thoughts or memories about your mom that keep you up, or is it more of a general feeling of anxiety or restlessness?

That tightness in your stomach is often a physical manifestation of anxiety or stress.\n\nI want to explore this further. When you have those moments where you're thinking about something random, like the store, and then suddenly your mind jumps to your mom, what is it about your mom that comes into your thoughts? Is it a specific memory, a feeling of grief, or perhaps a worry about something related to her passing? What do you think might be underlying those sudden shifts in thought?"

When you say that your mind is trying to process everything that's happened, but it's all jumbled up... what do you think is the most confusing or difficult part for you to process about your mom's passing? Is it the loss itself, the circumstances surrounding her death, or something else entirely?\n\nAlso, I've noticed that you mentioned feeling irritable and like everything is bothering you. Have you noticed any patterns or common themes in the things that trigger this irritability? For example, are there certain people, places, or situations that tend to set you off more than others? And how have you been coping with these feelings of irritability and anxiety on a daily basis? Are there any specific avoidance behaviors or strategies that you've been using to deal with them?\n\nLet's take a closer look at how these emotions are affecting your daily life. Can you tell me about a recent situation where you felt overwhelmed or irritable, and how you handled it? What did you do, and what was the outcome? By exploring these specific situations and behaviors, we can start to identify patterns and work together to develop more effective coping strategies."

You've been experiencing difficulty sleeping, feeling irritable, and having trouble processing your emotions since your mom's passing. You've also mentioned avoiding thinking about it too much because it feels overwhelming. Is that a fair summary?\n\nAlso, I want to ask one more question before we take a break from this topic. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to fully feel and process your emotions about your mom's passing? What's the worst that could happen, and what's the best that could happen? This might help us understand what's driving your avoidance behaviors and how we can work together to develop more effective coping strategies.\n\nRemember, we're not trying to force you to confront anything that feels too much right now. We're just taking small steps towards understanding and working through your emotions. If you need a break or want to switch topics, just let me know."

It sounds like you're feeling a sense of uncertainty and fear about fully processing your emotions, but at the same time, you're also hoping that it might bring some relief and clarity. That's a really brave and honest thing to acknowledge.\n\nLet's take a deep breath together and try to explore this further. What do you think is the worst-case scenario if you were to \"break down\" or feel overwhelmed by your emotions? What does that mean to you, and what are you most afraid of happening?\n\nAlso, I want to ask, have you noticed any physical symptoms or sensations in your body when you start to feel emotional or overwhelmed? For example, do you experience any tension, numbness, or pain? And how have these emotions been impacting your daily life, relationships, or work? Are there any specific situations or activities that you've been avoiding or struggling with since your mom's passing?"

It's as if your mind and body are saying, \"I just can't keep going right now.\"\n\nI want to acknowledge that this feeling of exhaustion is a common response to grief and trauma. It's like your system is overwhelmed, and it's struggling to cope with the emotional demands of processing your loss.\n\nLet's break this down a bit further. When you say that even simple tasks feel overwhelming, can you give me an example of something that normally wouldn't be a big deal, but now feels like too much? For instance, is it things like cooking meals, responding to emails, or interacting with friends and family?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this feeling of frustration. When you get frustrated easily, what does that look like for you? Do you find yourself snapping at people, or getting short-tempered with yourself? Are there any specific situations or triggers that tend to set off your frustration?\n\nRemember, we're not trying to add more to your plate right now.

Which isn't fair, because I know they're just trying to be supportive. But it's hard to explain... it's like everything just feels like too much right now.\n\n(rubbing temples again) And sometimes I get these headaches... (pausing, looking down) Yeah, that's been happening a lot lately too. Just feeling like my head is going to explode or something.

Those might seem like small tasks to some people, but they can feel monumental when you're dealing with emotional pain.\n\nIt's also really important to recognize that your friends are calling to check in because they care about you, and it's not uncommon for people to feel annoyed or frustrated when they're struggling emotionally. It doesn't mean you're not grateful for their support; it just means you're feeling overwhelmed right now.\n\nRegarding those headaches, have you noticed any patterns or triggers that might contribute to them? For example, do they happen when you're feeling particularly stressed or anxious, or are they more related to fatigue or lack of sleep?\n\nAlso, I want to ask, how have you been taking care of yourself physically and emotionally since your mom's passing? Are there any activities or rituals that bring you comfort, or things that help you feel more grounded and calm? We can explore some strategies together to help you manage these feelings and find ways to cope with the emotional exhaustion.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not be okay right now.

It's like, how can I possibly find the energy to do any of that when I can barely get out of bed?\n\n(looks up, eyes welling up with tears) Sorry, I just feel so stuck and lost right now. Like, I don't know how to move forward or what to do next. And it feels like everyone around me is expecting me to be okay, but I'm not okay.

It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take time to figure out how to move forward.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about those expectations from others. I want you to know that it's okay to tell people that you're not okay, and that you need time and space to grieve. You don't have to put on a brave face or pretend that everything is fine when it's not. It's okay to be vulnerable and to ask for help when you need it.\n\nNow, let's talk about taking care of yourself. I'm not going to suggest that you start doing anything drastic or overwhelming, because I know that's not what you need right now. But I do want to encourage you to take tiny, tiny steps towards self-care. Maybe it's just getting out of bed and making a cup of tea, or taking a few deep breaths outside in the fresh air. Maybe it's writing down your feelings in a journal, or listening to some soothing music.\n\nThe thing is, you don't have to have all the energy in the world to take care of yourself. You can start with tiny, manageable steps that feel doable to you right now. And I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nCan I ask you something? What's one tiny thing that you think might bring you a small sense of comfort or calmness right now? It could be anything - a warm bath, a favorite book, a cozy blanket... what comes to mind for you?\n\nAlso, I want to explore this feeling of being stuck and lost. Can you tell me more about what that feels like for you? Is it a sense of uncertainty about the future, or feeling overwhelmed by your emotions? Are there any specific thoughts or worries that are contributing to this feeling of being stuck? By understanding this better, we can start to work together to develop some strategies to help you feel more grounded and hopeful."
