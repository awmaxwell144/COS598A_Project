Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

When you think about all the things you need to do tomorrow, what is it about those tasks that's worrying you? Is it the fear of not getting them done, or something else?

What do you think you're expecting from yourself right now that you're not meeting?

It's beautiful that you're holding onto those memories and using them to guide you through this tough time.\n\nNow, let's talk about what it would take for you to start asking for help.

We're just taking small, gentle steps towards finding more balance and support in your life. And I'm here to walk alongside you every step of the way. What do you say?

But it sounds like you're recognizing that pushing her away might not be the best approach, and that opening up to her could actually bring you closer together.\n\nRemember, asking for help is not a burden - it's an act of trust and intimacy. By sharing your feelings and struggles with your sister, you're giving her the opportunity to support you and be there for you in a meaningful way. And who knows, she might be feeling overwhelmed or struggling herself, and talking to you could be a relief for both of you.\n\nAs you prepare to talk to your sister, what do you think you'll say to her?

In fact, it's great that you're recognizing your own limitations and acknowledging that you need help. That takes a lot of courage and self-awareness.\n\nWhen you talk to your sister, try to be as specific as possible about what you need from her. For example, you could say something like, \"Hey, I'm feeling really overwhelmed with everything right now, and I was wondering if we could work together to prioritize some tasks and make a plan for getting things done.\" Or, \"I'm struggling with feelings of guilt and anxiety, and it would really help me to talk through some of these emotions with you.\"\n\nRemember, the goal is not to put all of your burdens on your sister's shoulders, but to work together as a team to find solutions and offer support. By being open and honest with her, you're taking the first step towards building a stronger, more supportive relationship.\n\nNow, let's talk about what you might expect from this conversation with your sister.

We've both been dealing with a lot since Mom passed away, and I don't want to add to her stress. But at the same time, I think it's better for us to be open and honest with each other about how we're feeling.\n\nI'm also hoping that talking to my sister will help me feel more connected to her again. We've been drifting apart a bit since Mom's passing, and I miss our close relationship. I think this conversation could be a good opportunity for us to reconnect and support each other in a way that feels meaningful.\n\n*pauses, looking thoughtful* You know, just thinking about having this conversation with my sister is making me feel a little better. It's like I'm already feeling more hopeful and less alone, just knowing that I have someone to talk to who cares about me."
