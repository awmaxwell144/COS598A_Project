    "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, irritability, excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and somatic complaints (like stomach discomfort or headaches). This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

Is it nausea, cramps, or just a general feeling of unease in your stomach? And does this discomfort seem to be triggered by specific thoughts or situations, like when you think about the car accident, or is it more of a constant background feeling?\n\nAlso, what do you think you might be trying to \"do\" when you feel the urge to get up and take action? Are you trying to distract yourself from your thoughts, or is there something specific that you feel like you need to accomplish or resolve?"

Is it related to the accident, or is there something else that's worrying you? For example, are you concerned about the consequences of the accident, or maybe worried about getting into another one?\n\nAlso, when you get these headaches, are they triggered by specific situations or thoughts, or do they seem to come out of nowhere?

It's like your nervous system is still on high alert, and little things can trigger big reactions.\n\nLet's explore this feeling of \"something's off\" a bit more. What do you think might be contributing to this sense of unease? Is it just the accident, or are there other stressors in your life that could be playing a role? For example, are there any changes or challenges at work or in your personal relationships that might be adding to your anxiety?\n\nAlso, when you felt like yelling at your coworker for tapping their pen, what was going through your mind in that moment? Were you thinking \"This is so annoying,\" or was it more like \"I just can't take this right now\"? What did you do instead of yelling, and how did you calm yourself down?"

What are some things that usually help you unwind and feel more at ease?\n\nWe can talk about something more lighthearted for a bit, and then when you're feeling more ready, we can gently come back to exploring these feelings and thoughts together.
