Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Sometimes our bodies can manifest physical symptoms when we're feeling stressed or overwhelmed.\n\nLet's try to break this down a bit. What is it about your mom's passing that's feeling most overwhelming to you right now? Is it the emotional loss, the practical tasks like arranging things and dealing with paperwork, or something else entirely?"

It sounds like you're recognizing that your reactions might not be entirely about the other person, but more about how you're feeling inside.\n\nLet's explore this a bit further. When you say \"everything\" is feeling overwhelming, what do you think is at the root of that feeling? Is it the loss of your mom, the changes that are happening in your life as a result, or something deeper, like a fear of not being able to cope or a sense of uncertainty about the future? What is it that's making you feel like you're barely holding things together?"

It's like your body and mind are saying, \"Hey, we need a break, we need to rest and recharge.\"\n\nCan you tell me more about what you think is contributing to this feeling of exhaustion? Is it the emotional weight of grieving, the stress of dealing with practical tasks and responsibilities, or something else entirely?

Are you getting caught up in thoughts about your mom, or worries about the future, or something else entirely?

When you say your thoughts feel \"jumbled,\" what do you mean by that? Are they racing, or are they more muddled and unclear?

It's like your heart is saying, \"I'm not ready to feel anything yet,\" and that's okay. We can take things at your pace, and explore what feels comfortable for you.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention looking at old photos might be too painful right now. That suggests that there might be some emotions or memories that are still feeling really raw and tender. Maybe we can explore some ways to approach those feelings in a way that feels safe and manageable for you.\n\nFor now, I just want to say that it's okay to take things one step at a time, and to focus on getting through each day without putting too much pressure on yourself. We can work together to find ways to make the numbness feel more manageable, and to help you start feeling more connected to your emotions and thoughts again.\n\nLet's try to summarize what we've talked about so far. You've been experiencing excessive worry, physical symptoms like tension and headaches, and difficulty sleeping. You've also been feeling overwhelmed, irritable, and disconnected from your daily life. We've explored how these feelings might be related to the loss of your mom, and how being alone can make the numbness feel more intense.\n\nBefore we move forward, I want to check in with you about a few other things. Have you noticed any avoidance behaviors, such as avoiding certain places or activities that remind you of your mom? And how have these feelings been impacting your social or occupational life? For example, have you had to take time off work or avoid spending time with friends and family?"

It's just too hard for me right now.\n\nAnd as for my social life...*pauses* I've been kind of pulling away from my friends and family, to be honest. I don't know, it's just that I don't feel like I can talk to them about how I'm really feeling. They all seem so concerned and supportive, but at the same time, they don't really get it. They didn't lose their mom, you know? *looks up briefly, then back down*\n\nI haven't had to take time off work or anything, but it's been hard to focus on my job lately. I just feel like I'm going through the motions, like I said before. And when I'm at work, I feel like I'm just pretending to be okay, you know? Like, I'm putting on this mask of being fine, but really I'm just struggling to get through each day.\n\n*pauses again* I don't know, it's just all so hard right now.
