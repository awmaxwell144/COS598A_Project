You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

When you feel these knots or the weight in your stomach, is it usually triggered by specific thoughts or memories of your mom, or does it seem to come out of nowhere? For example, do you notice that it happens when you're thinking about a particular aspect of her passing, like the funeral or sorting through her belongings?\n\nAlso, how have you been taking care of yourself physically and emotionally since your mom passed away?

It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. Avoiding certain situations or places can be a way of protecting yourself from feeling too much pain, but it can also prevent you from processing your emotions and moving forward.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention feeling irritable and having trouble concentrating. These can be common symptoms of grief, as well as anxiety and depression. It's possible that your brain is just feeling overwhelmed and struggling to keep up with everything.\n\nI'd like to explore this idea of the \"big empty space\" you mentioned earlier.

That takes a lot of self-awareness, and it's a great starting point for us to work with.

What if, instead of trying to fill the space, we focus on finding ways to honor your mom's memory and incorporate her into your life in meaningful ways? For example, you could try cooking one of her favorite recipes, watching that TV show together with your partner or a friend, or even just looking at old photos and sharing stories about her. Sometimes, embracing these memories and emotions can help us feel more connected to our loved ones, rather than trying to escape the pain.\n\nRegarding your daily life, I want to make sure we're covering all aspects of how you've been feeling since your mom passed away.

We could also explore ways to create a memory book or scrapbook together, where you can collect memories and stories about your mom.\n\nRegarding your concentration and focus, it might be helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself each day.
