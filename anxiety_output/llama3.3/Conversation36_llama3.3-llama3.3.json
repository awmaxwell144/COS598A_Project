Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible.

Is it with your hands, like tapping or playing with objects, or is it more like restlessness in your legs or entire body?

It's like your mind is a engine that won't quiet down. \n\nWhen you say \"racing thoughts,\" what kind of thoughts are they?

It takes a lot of courage to share this kind of stuff, so thank you for trusting me with it.\n\nI want to explore this a bit further. When you think about your mom and what she would say if she were here, what is it that you're hoping she would say?

Why don't we take a few deep breaths together, and I'll guide you through a brief relaxation exercise to help calm your mind and body? Sometimes, taking a step back and resetting can help us come back to the conversation with renewed clarity and energy.\n\nLet's take a pause, and when you're ready, we can gently revisit the topic. Your well-being is my top priority, so please don't worry about \"not being able to think about this right now.\" We'll work at your pace, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.\n\nTake a deep breath in with me... hold it for a second... and exhale slowly.

Can you tell me more about what you think would help you feel refilled or rejuvenated? Is there something specific that comes to mind, like spending time in nature, talking to a loved one, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy?\n\n*I lean forward slightly, my eyes locked on yours* And I want you to know that it's okay to not have all the answers right now.

It's a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time.\n\n*I lean forward, my voice filled with empathy* You're not alone in feeling lost or uncertain about how to navigate your emotions. It's completely normal to feel like you're wandering around in a fog, trying to find your way out. And it's beautiful that talking to me makes you feel a little better - that's exactly what I'm here for.\n\n*I reach out and offer a gentle, comforting touch on your arm* Please don't apologize for struggling or for not knowing what to do. That's exactly why we're having this conversation - to explore your feelings, to process your emotions, and to find ways to support you through this difficult time.\n\n*I take a deep breath and continue* You know, grief is not something that you need to \"get over\" or \"move on\" from in a certain amount of time. It's a process that unfolds at its own pace, and it's okay to take as much time as you need. What's important is that you're allowing yourself to feel your emotions, to acknowledge your pain, and to seek support when you need it.\n\n*I smile softly* And I'm here to support you every step of the way. We'll work together to find ways to help you cope with your grief, to process your emotions, and to find a sense of peace and healing. You don't have to do this alone - I'm here to walk alongside you, to listen, and to offer guidance when you need it.\n\n*I pause for a moment, then ask* Can you tell me more about what you mean by \"feeling lost\"? Is it a sense of disorientation, like you're not sure who you are or where you fit in the world without your mom? Or is it more of a feeling of being disconnected from others, like you're struggling to find people who understand what you're going through?"

    "content": "*I look up at you with tears still welling up in my eyes* It's... it's both, I think. I feel like a part of me is missing now that my mom is gone, and I'm not sure who I am without her. We were so close, and she was always there for me, no matter what. And now that she's not here, I feel lost and alone, like I'm drifting through life without an anchor.\n\n*I take a deep breath and continue* And at the same time, I do feel disconnected from others. My friends and family are all trying to be supportive, but they don't really understand what I'm going through. They keep telling me to \"stay strong\" or \"be brave,\" but that just makes me feel like I'm not allowed to feel my emotions. Like I have to put on a mask and pretend everything is okay when it's not.\n\n*I look down, my voice barely above a whisper* Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions of daily life without any real purpose or direction. I wake up in the morning, go through my routine, and then just exist until bedtime. But what's the point of it all? My mom was always the one who gave me guidance and support... now that she's gone, I feel like I'm just wandering aimlessly.\n\n*I glance up at you, hoping for reassurance* Does that make sense? Am I just being selfish or weak for feeling this way?"

    "role": "therapist",
    "content": "*I listen attentively to your words, my expression filled with empathy and understanding* Oh, sweetie, it makes perfect sense. You're not being selfish or weak for feeling this way. You're being human, and you're allowing yourself to feel the depth of your emotions.\n\n*I nod gently* It's completely normal to feel lost and alone after losing someone as close to you as your mom. She was a significant part of your life, and her absence has left a gaping hole that can't be filled by anyone else. It's okay to acknowledge that and to grieve the loss of your relationship with her.\n\n*I offer a reassuring smile* And it's not just about feeling lost; it's also about feeling disconnected from others. When people tell you to \"stay strong\" or \"be brave,\" they might be trying to help, but they're not always understanding the complexity of your emotions. It's like they're asking you to put on a mask and pretend everything is okay when it's not.\n\n*I lean forward slightly* But here's the thing: you don't have to wear that mask with me. You can be yourself, with all your emotions and vulnerabilities, and I'll be here to support you without judgment. It's okay to feel weak, to feel sad, to feel lost. Those feelings are valid, and they're a natural part of the grieving process.\n\n*I take a deep breath* As for feeling like you're just going through the motions of daily life, that's also a common experience after a significant loss. It's like you're in a state of limbo, where nothing feels quite real or meaningful. But I want you to know that this is temporary. With time, patience, and support, you'll start to find your way again. You'll begin to discover new purposes, new passions, and new meanings in life.\n\n*I look at you with kindness and compassion* And it's okay if that takes time. It's okay if you don't have all the answers right now. What's important is that you're taking small steps towards healing, and that you're allowing yourself to feel your emotions. That takes courage, sweetie, and I'm so proud of you for being brave enough to face your feelings head-on.\n\n*I pause for a moment* Now, I want to ask you something: what do you think would help you feel more connected to yourself and to others right now? Is there something specific that comes to mind, like talking to a friend, engaging in a hobby, or practicing self-care?"
  },
  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "*I look up at you with tears still welling up in my eyes* I think what would help me feel more connected to myself and to others is to just be able to talk about my mom without feeling like I'm burdening anyone. I want to share stories about her, remember the good times we had together, and just feel like I can be honest about how much I miss her.\n\n*I take a deep breath* It's hard for me to find people who understand what I'm going through, because they didn't know my mom like I did. But talking to you makes me feel like I can be myself, and that you're really listening to what I have to say.\n\n*I smile slightly* I also think it would help if I could find some way to honor my mom's memory, whether that's through a ritual, a tradition, or just something that feels meaningful to me. I want to feel like I'm keeping her spirit alive, even though she's not physically here with me anymore.\n\n*I look at you with hope in my eyes* Do you think that's something we could work on together? Finding ways for me to connect with my mom's memory, and to feel more connected to myself and others as I navigate this grieving process?"
