Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, irritability, excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and somatic complaints (like stomach discomfort or headaches). This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

It's like your heart is still expecting her to be there, and it's hard to adjust to the new reality.\n\nLet's take a gentle step further... when you think about not being able to call your mom or share things with her, what do you think is the hardest part of that for you?

It's completely understandable that little things are bothering you more than they used to, and that you're feeling more irritable and reactive.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention feeling like you're \"waiting for something to go wrong\" or for someone to say something that will set you off.

It's not uncommon for people to experience physical symptoms when they're feeling overwhelmed emotionally. However, if these symptoms persist or worsen over time, it's always a good idea to consult with a medical professional to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nI also want to acknowledge the avoidance behaviors you mentioned, such as avoiding social activities or trying new things.

They don't understand what I'm going through, and it feels like they're just waiting for me to \"get over it\" or something. *looks up, slightly frustrated*\n\nI guess that's why it's been nice talking to you.
