Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: excessive worry, physical symptoms (e.g., heart rate, tension, sweating), sleep, concentration, avoidance behaviors, and social or occupational impact. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end. Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the frequency, intensity, duration, triggers, and specific manifestations of the symptoms. Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs. In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support, and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise.",

This condition is caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that has made you feel anxious and overwhelmed, even if you can't fully articulate why. You are confused about your symptoms and unsure what's causing them, but you want to feel better. Don't explicitly say that you have anxiety or are anxious. Simulate the behavior of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once \u2014 only one symptom per round. You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what's been stressing you, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or avoid answering or respond briefly because you might feel nervous or uncomfortable opening up. Be very concise, as concise as possible. Remember that your symptoms are caused by a recent event \u2014 which event? \u2014 that triggered these feelings.",

Is it like you're waiting for something to happen, or that you're bracing yourself for something bad to occur? And when you try to relax, what gets in the way of that for you?

For example, are they more likely to occur at certain times of day, or in specific situations, such as when you're around certain people or in crowded spaces?

Can you tell me more about what specifically feels \"too hard\" about going to your mom's house or talking to friends and family? Is it the fear of emotional overwhelm, worry about being judged or pitied, or something else?\n\nAlso, when you say that their questions or sympathy feel \"raw,\" what do you mean by that?

Grief can be a really isolating experience, especially when it feels like others don't fully understand what you're going through.\n\nWhen you say that nothing feels \"real or meaningful\" right now, what do you think is missing?

It's like you're caught between two conflicting desires: the desire to hold onto the hope that your mom will come back, and the desire to acknowledge the reality of her passing and start to heal. And talking about it can be a double-edged sword - on the one hand, it can bring some relief and help you process your emotions, but on the other hand, it can also make everything feel more real and painful.\n\nIt's okay to feel that way, by the way. Grief is a complicated and messy process, and there's no right or wrong way to navigate it. It sounds like you're doing the best you can, which is all anyone can ask for.\n\nI want to go back to something you said earlier - about feeling like there's \"unfinished business\" between you and your mom. Can you tell me more about what that means to you? Is it specific conversations or experiences that you wish you'd had with her, or is it more of a general sense of regret or longing?\n\nAlso, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to talk about this stuff, especially when it's still feeling so raw and emotional. It's okay to take things at your own pace, and to only share as much as you feel comfortable with. But if you're willing, I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can.\n\nIn terms of moving forward, it might be helpful to explore some ways to honor your mom's memory and acknowledge the impact she had on your life. This could be something as simple as looking at old photos or mementos, or it could be something more involved like writing a letter or creating a memorial. What do you think might help you feel more connected to your mom, even though she's no longer physically present?"

  {
    "role": "patient",
    "content": "(pauses, taking a deep breath) I think what I mean by \"unfinished business\" is that there are just so many things we never got to talk about or experience together. Like, we always talked about traveling together, but we never got the chance. And there were so many conversations we started but never finished... (trails off)\n\nIt's hard to explain, but it feels like there's this sense of incompleteness, like our relationship was cut short before we could resolve everything. And I know that's not possible, but it's just hard for me to accept that I'll never get to have those conversations or experiences with her again.\n\n(looks down, fidgeting with hands) As for honoring her memory, I'm not sure... I think looking at old photos might be a good place to start. We had so many happy times together, and I feel like looking at those memories might help me hold onto the good stuff, you know? But it's scary too, because it feels like if I start looking at all those old pictures and mementos, I'll just get caught up in the sadness again.\n\n(pauses, collecting thoughts) But maybe that's what I need to do. Maybe I need to face the sadness head-on and work through it, rather than trying to avoid it all the time. Does that make sense?"
